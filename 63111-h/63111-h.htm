<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<p class="center p-left sm">FEBRUARY, MARCH 1918 (4TH BATTALION)</p>


<div class="sidenote">4th Batt. Feb. 1918.</div>

<p>On February 12 the 4th Battalion left the Guards Division, and was
played out by the drums of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Battalions Grenadier
Guards, the pipers of the 2nd Battalion Scots Guards, and the band of
the Irish Guards. Brigadier-General Lord Henry Seymour watched the
Battalion march by, and congratulated Lieut.-Colonel Pilcher on its
smart appearance.</p>

<p>Thus the newly formed 4th Guards Brigade joined the Thirty-First
Division. On the 14th Major-General Sir Charles Fergusson, Commanding
the Thirteenth Corps, inspected the Battalion, and expressed himself
very pleased with its appearance on parade. On the 17th the Battalion
relieved the Durham Light Infantry in the line near Arleux Loop,
and was subjected to a slight shelling. This was the new Brigade's
first tour in the trenches, and the 4th Battalion was the first of
the three Battalions to go into the front line. The line taken over
was an example of the new system of holding the front in depth. The
Brigade frontage, 2000 yards in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span> length, was held by one Battalion,
and constituted the outpost line. Held very lightly by posts at long
intervals, it was supported some 1000 yards in rear by a trench, known
as the Arleux Loop, South and North, where the Battalion Headquarters
were situated together with one company in reserve. Lieut.-Colonel
Pilcher was aware that the arrival of a fresh Battalion in the line
was likely to be observed by the enemy, and that therefore a raid was
highly probable. If any confirmation of this theory was required it had
already been supplied by a prisoner, who had been captured before the
relief, and had stated that the enemy suspected the presence of the
Guards Division, and intended shortly to make a raid to confirm the
fact. Nothing, however, was observed either to indicate the exact time
or the locality; in fact, everything seemed normal, and the officer
commanding the 2nd Battalion Irish Guards went round the posts with
Lieut.-Colonel Pilcher in the usual way in order to make the necessary
arrangements for the relief the next morning.</p>

<p>From the evidence of the single surviving prisoner, who was captured,
it was clear that the Germans had planned and rehearsed every detail
of the coming raid with great thoroughness. Practice trenches, made
from aeroplane photographs, had been dug in Beaumont, and the raiders
were minutely trained in their duties. All the men who were to take
part in the raid had been withdrawn from the line for three weeks,
and had been well fed and cared for. They were the pick of the 469th
German Infantry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span> Regiment, and had been selected on account of their
physique and proved courage. Their equipment was of high quality,
with every detail carefully thought out; it consisted of a short,
light rifle of 1917 pattern with a leather sling, a trench dagger, an
automatic pistol, wire-cutters, a watch, and a canvas bag for carrying
stick-bombs.</p>

<p>The raid, which had been planned by the Regimental Staff of the 469th
Regiment, was carried out in two sections, each consisting of 1
officer and 28 other ranks, in all about 60. At 8 P.M. a concentrated
bombardment was put down by the enemy from Oak Post on the left to
Tommy Post on the right, and the bombardment was so intense that
portions of our trenches were completely obliterated. An S.O.S. signal
went up some way to the left of Oak Post, and our barrage came down
with great promptitude opposite that part of the line; thus valuable
time was lost in having it transferred to where the raid was actually
taking place.</p>

<p>Shortly after the enemy's barrage was put down, the men in No. 8
Post saw a strong party of Germans advancing down Brandy Trench from
Tee Trench, and a fierce fight commenced. Seeing they were greatly
outnumbered, our men slowly closed in on No. 7 Post. After the
bombardment began, Captain Benson at No. 2 Company Headquarters sent
Second Lieutenant Wrixon to ascertain what was happening, and this
officer, after passing through the enemy's barrage, came up just as
No. 8 Post was joining No. 7. He at once took charge of both posts,
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span> concentrated his men in Beer Trench, which he determined to
hold to the last. He now had 2 N.C.O.'s and 12 men to oppose to the
raiding party. The Germans on reaching Brandy Trench split up into
two parties; one party continued to bomb up the trench while another,
which comprised the majority, rushed across the open towards Beer
Trench, with the obvious intention of cutting off these posts. Private
Fletcher, No. 1 of the Lewis-gun team in No. 7 Post, saw them coming,
and at once turned his gun on them. Several dropped, and the remainder
fled, carrying their wounded with them. No sooner was this party
disposed of than Lieutenant Wrixon saw a fresh group of men, advancing
stealthily down the trench in front of him. Instead of waiting for
them, he determined to attack them, and advancing down the trench he
shot the first man he met dead with his revolver. His next opponent at
once flung a bomb at him, which burst within a few feet, only slightly
wounding him. Private Coles, who was just behind him, shot the man dead
with his rifle at point-blank range. Then a bugle was blown, and the
raiders disappeared. During this fight the Germans attempted an old
ruse by calling out in perfect English: "Take off your gas respirators
and return to your support line." Some of the men repeated these
instructions under the impression they came from one of their officers,
but Second Lieutenant Wrixon yelled at the men, and countermanded the
spurious order.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the fight, when No. 8 Post was falling back on
No. 7, Private Taylor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span> who had been sent back to No. 8 Post to fetch
some bombs, which had been left behind, ran straight into the arms of
a party of Germans, and was taken prisoner. He was ordered on pain of
death to lead the Germans to No. 14 Post, and feigned to be willing to
do so, when the raiders suddenly changed their minds, and told him to
lead them back to their own lines. He at once acquiesced, but instead
of doing so, led them to the strongest post in our line. When he knew
he was within a few yards of Nos. 7 and 8 Posts, he shouted a warning
to the garrison, and threw himself on the ground. His warning was heard
by his comrades, who at once hurled bombs in the direction of his
voice, and the Germans fled, abandoning their prisoner. Unfortunately,
one of our bombs wounded Private Taylor, but he was finally rescued by
Private Cunliffe, a stretcher-bearer who had already behaved with great
gallantry, bringing in the wounded under heavy shell-fire.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a totally distinct fight took place at Nos. 13 and 14
Posts, generally known as Alton Post, where there was a machine-gun
protected by a bombing-post, under Lieutenant W. B. Ball. It happened
that a party of Royal Engineers, under an officer, was working at the
machine-gun dug-out that night. The machine-gun itself was knocked out
by the first few shells of the barrage, and a small party of Germans
immediately afterwards emerged from the darkness, and rushed at the
post. Corporal Horan, who was in charge of the bombing-post, disabled
three of them with well-directed bombs, but one very tall German,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
followed by some more, broke through, and proceeded to throw bombs
down the dug-out. It was all done in a moment, and the officer of the
Royal Engineers, who was in the dug-out, having just escaped the first
bomb, ran round to another exit, when he narrowly missed a second one,
before he got out into the open. Meanwhile, Private Moore, a Grenadier
attached to the Royal Engineers, closed with the leading German, and
was stabbed to death. Corporal Horan then came up, and shot the tall
German dead. Presumably the leaders of the party had all been accounted
for, as the remainder turned and disappeared into the darkness.</p>

<p>It is difficult to estimate with any accuracy the enemy's casualties,
since there is no doubt they were able to carry away most of their
wounded and even their dead. It is only possible, therefore, to state
the actual number of dead and wounded left in our lines. These were: 2
killed and 5 wounded, 4 of whom subsequently died. The casualties in
the Grenadiers were: 2 killed, 2 died of wounds, and 5 wounded. It was
a distinctly unfortunate raid for the Germans, who had taken infinite
pains to make it a success; yet not only had they suffered heavy loss,
but they had failed to obtain an identification of any kind either in
the nature of a prisoner or a bit of equipment. With 2 officers and
nearly 60 men, they imagined they would make short work of 12 men under
one officer, but they had the misfortune to meet some tough fighters,
who were anxious to come to close quarters with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>Brigadier-General Lord Ardee two days later received the following
message:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Corps Commander requests that you will convey to the
officers and men of the 4th Battalion Grenadier Guards his
high appreciation of the gallant and successful resistance put
up by the garrison of Arleux Post on the night of February
19-20. He wishes also to congratulate the Thirty-first
Division on having completely repulsed for the fourth time
in succession during the last two months determined and
elaborately prepared attempts to penetrate their lines.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 21st the 4th Battalion was relieved by the 2nd Battalion Irish
Guards, and retired to Ecurie Camp for four days' rest, after which it
returned to the front trenches. On the 23rd the sad news of the death
of Lieutenant Ludlow was received. He had been universally popular as
Quartermaster of the Battalion, and had only just retired to take up an
appointment at Chelsea Hospital, when he was killed by a bomb dropped
by a German aeroplane during a raid on London.</p>

<div class="sidenote">4th Batt. March 1918.</div>

<p>On March 21 the 4th Battalion was in billets in the
Cheiers-Guestreville-Bethencourt area, and the Brigade as part of the
Thirty-first Division was in General Headquarters Reserve, when an
order arrived, warning all Battalions to be ready to move the next
morning. At 10 a.m. the 4th Battalion started off in buses, and with
the rest of the Brigade moved <i>via</i> St. Pol and Doulens to Blairville.
It was now to take part in ten strenuous days' fighting, digging, and
marching, in open warfare of the kind associated with the retreat from
Mons in 1914, and to forgo the comparative comforts of an established
trench<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span> line. The following officers took part in these operations:</p>

<p>During the early morning shells were heard passing over at a great
height, and as the Battalion went through St. Pol it was clear that
the enemy had begun a systematic bombardment of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span> back areas, and
was paying particular attention to that town. Lieut.-Colonel Pilcher,
who had gone on ahead with Lord Ardee, sent back word for the buses to
proceed through Blairville to the cross-roads west of Boisleux-au-Mont.
There he summoned the Company Commanders, and explained the situation
to them. From where they were the men could see a large fire burning on
the sky-line, and this proved to be the canteen at Boisleux-au-Mont,
which was destroyed together with many thousand pounds' worth of food
in order to prevent these stores falling into the hands of the Germans.
Whether these drastic measures were necessary seems doubtful, since
the enemy did not reach this place till four days later. Guided by
Lieut.-Colonel Pilcher, the 4th Battalion moved through Hamelincourt
to a ravine east of the Ervillers-Boyelles road, where it arrived on
the morning of the 23rd. The line occupied by the 4th Guards Brigade
ran through Judas Farm, to the east of Ervillers; St. Leger was in the
hands of the Germans. The 4th Battalion and the 2nd Battalion Irish
Guards held the front line, while the 3rd Battalion Coldstream Guards
was in support. During the morning the news reached the Battalion that
the enemy had broken through at Mory, and that the right flank of the
Brigade was in danger; this was contradicted later. An order issued
to the Battalion to feel its right, and take over ground occupied by
the Fortieth Division was never carried out, as the troops on the
right refused to move, stating that they had received no orders. Then
commenced a most harassing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
shelling of our trenches by our own guns, which every effort on the
part of the Commanding Officer failed to stop. Both British and German
shells fell on our trenches and caused many casualties, including
Second Lieutenant Gilbey, who was wounded. Nor was the shelling the
only annoyance: the men in the front trench were constantly employed
in repelling attacks, and fired off no less than 80,000 cartridges,
inflicting continual losses on the advancing enemy. The fighting went
on intermittently all day, and, although the enemy continually attacked
the Brigade front, he was unable to make the slightest impression on
the line. That night Lord Ardee issued definite orders for the whole
Brigade to "side step" 1000 yards to the right, in order to close
any gaps that might exist near Mory. When the order was carried out
the next morning, the 2nd Battalion Irish Guards found no troops on
its right, and was in a precarious position. During the whole day
constant rumours of trouble on the right succeeded each other, and in
the evening the news arrived that the Fortieth Division had suffered
so severely that it had been relieved by the Forty-second Division.
Still the line remained intact, and the German attacks only resulted in
masses of their men being killed. The constant strain on our men was,
however, beginning to tell, and all ranks were glad when darkness came
down, and the attacks ceased. A curious order was issued warning the
men against spies dressed as British officers, who were spreading false
reports, with the object of hastening our retirement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">4th Batt. Mar. 25, 1918</div>

<div class="sidenote">Mar. 26.</div>

<p>During the morning of the 25th the Companies were warned of a possible
retirement under cover of darkness, and about noon it became certain
that the line had given way on the right, for men from various units
began coming back from the direction of Mory, followed by platoons
led by officers; and at 1 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> Captain Chapman, who went
with the Commanding Officers of the Coldstream and Irish Guards to
reconnoitre, reported Germans coming over the ridge on the right in
large numbers. This information was at once passed on to Lord Ardee,
who gave orders to evacuate the line and fall back north-west of
Courcelles. The situation when the order for retirement arrived was
extremely difficult, for not only had the right given way entirely,
but the enemy was advancing in some force directly against the
Battalion Headquarters of the Grenadiers and Coldstream, and there
seemed nothing to prevent their penetrating to the rear of the two
Battalions. Lieut.-Colonel Pilcher immediately withdrew Nos. 2 and 3
Companies under Captain Benson and Lieutenant Lyon, and placed them on
the high ground behind Battalion Headquarters, whence they would be
instantly available for a counter-attack in case of emergency. All the
time the shelling continued, and the retirement had to be carried out
with the enemy unpleasantly close. While the order was being executed
Captain Benson was wounded, and was in danger of being left behind, but
was gallantly rescued and carried back by Sergeant Marsh. Indeed the
evacuation of all the wounded of the 4th Guards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> Brigade was a notably
fine piece of work. No wounded man was left to fall into the enemy's
hands, although the medical officers of the Coldstream and Irish Guards
and the sick-sergeant of the Grenadiers remained behind, after their
Battalions had retired, and the enemy was within a few hundred yards
of their aid-posts. Whether our artillery was imperfectly informed
as to the movements of the infantry in front, or whether they gave
the enemy credit for more rapidity than they possessed, is not clear,
but an unfortunate incident occurred which completely prevented a
counter-attack being made, when there was an opportunity of inflicting
a severe blow on the advancing enemy. A Company of Coldstream had been
formed up for a counter-attack, when, without any warning, our heavy
artillery poured shells on their Battalion Headquarters, where they
were assembling, causing a number of casualties. Although there was
constant shelling, the enemy seemed unwilling to come to close quarters
with the 4th Guards Brigade, and consequently when it became dark the
position remained unchanged, save for a strong defensive flank drawn
back on the right. That night the Companies were warned to assemble at
Battalion Headquarters, but when once more our heavy artillery began to
shell that particular spot, runners were despatched to alter the point
of assembly. Captain O'Brien, Irish Guards, was wounded by a shell, and
shortly afterwards Second Lieutenant Dawson-Greene was hit by another
at the assembly point, and died of the wounds he received some days
later. The Battalion formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
up in the sunken road to the rear of Battalion Headquarters, and
marched off to the Crucifix at Moyenneville, which it reached at 1
<span class="smcap">A.M.</span> the next morning. Immediately it arrived, it dug a new
line of trenches east of the village, and the men were supplied with
hot food from the cookers which had been sent up. All the time the
German artillery continued to shell Moyenneville without inflicting
any casualties. At 4.30 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> the Battalion received orders
to retire to Ayette, and to hand over its positions to the troops
in front of it. Two hours later it moved back through Ayette to
Douchy-les-Ayette, where the Battalion Headquarters were established.
At noon an order arrived from Lord Ardee, assigning to the Battalion
the special rôle of occupying and fortifying Quesnoy Farm, and two
hours later it took up its new position. No. 3 Company, under Captain
G. C. Sloane-Stanley, on the left; No. 4, under Lieutenant Minchin,
in the centre; and No. 1, under Captain H. H. Sloane-Stanley, on the
right, dug in east of the farm, while No. 2, under Lieutenant T. Pryce,
remained in support behind the trench. The men were dead beat, having
worked and fought unceasingly for the last three days, and it was a
great relief to all ranks when the night passed quietly. An alarming
message of undoubted German origin was received, stating that the enemy
had broken through at Hebuterne with armoured motors, but this was
subsequently refuted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mar. 27.</div>

<div class="sidenote">March 28-31.</div>

<p>Early in the morning of the 27th it was reported that the 93rd Brigade
was retiring on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span> the left, and this information was at once passed on
to the Brigade Headquarters; at first it was thought best to support
this Brigade, and an order to that effect was issued. This was,
however, cancelled later, and Lieut.-Colonel Pilcher was instructed to
send one Company to each of the other two Battalions of the Brigade.
Captain G. C. Sloane-Stanley and Lieutenant T. Pryce went off at once
with Nos. 1 and 2 Companies, and did not come under the orders of
the 4th Battalion again until the night of relief. In the meantime
the enemy determined to take advantage of the retirement of the 93rd
Brigade, and commenced to mass two battalions near the aerodrome
outside Ayette. This tempting target was not lost on our artillery,
but, in order that it might catch as large a number of the enemy as
possible, it waited until the movement was nearly completed. Then with
a deafening noise all available guns concentrated their fire on this
spot, with the result that the most of the force was annihilated,
and the survivors fled in disorder. It was as fine a bit of shooting
as any one could wish to see, and the results astonished even the
gunners themselves. Nos. 1 and 2 Companies, which had gone up to the
front line, were able, in spite of the cold and wet, to dig and wire a
formidable system of trenches. On
the 28th Nos. 3 and 4 Companies moved to the left, and occupied a line
that had been dug by the 3rd Battalion Coldstream Guards. The following
three days passed quietly, and on the night of the 31st the Battalion
was relieved by the 16th Battalion of the Lancashire Fusiliers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span> and
marched back to Bienvillers. The total casualties incurred during the

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<p class="center p-left sm">APRIL, MAY, JUNE 1918</p>

<p class="center p-left"><i>Diary of the War</i></p>


<div class="sidenote">1918</div>

<p>The Germans, finding that their advance was being brought to a
standstill in the direction of Amiens, turned their attention farther
north, and determined to threaten the Channel ports. On April 9 they
began a concentrated attack with nine divisions on the British and
Portuguese front between Armentières and La Bassée, and the fighting
spread to Messines. Bailleul and Wulverghem, amongst other places,
fell, and the Germans reached the Forest of Nieppe. Here they were
checked, and at the end of April the German effort had spent itself,
although Marshal Foch had been obliged to expend much of his reserve.
The Germans had suffered enormous losses, and, though the German people
rejoiced at the gain of territory, those who knew the true state of
affairs were alarmed at the extravagant expenditure of men.</p>

<p>At the end of May Ludendorff determined to go straight for Paris, and
with twenty-five divisions overwhelmed the French between Soissons and
Rheims. This German onslaught continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> with varying success until it
reached Château-Thierry. The stubborn resistance of the French made any
farther advance impossible, and, although the battle still raged on a
gigantic front, the Germans had to abandon their intention of striking
at Paris.</p>

<p>In April Naval raids on Zeebrugge and Ostend were made, and two ships
filled with concrete were successfully sunk at the entrance of the
Bruges Canal, while an obsolete submarine and two other ships were
blown up off the Mole at Ostend.</p>

<p>In Italy the Austrians began offensive operations on a large scale,
and crossed the Piave River, but the Italians, by a series of
counterattacks, regained the lost ground, and by the end of June had
driven back the Austrians with heavy loss across the river.</p>

<div class="sidenote">April.</div>

<p>After the very strenuous days at the end of March, when the German
attacks were successfully repelled, the 1st Battalion remained in the
front line for two days, but whether the enemy considered it wiser
to try some other parts of the line, or whether they were merely
waiting for reinforcements, they showed very little signs of life.
A heavy bombardment, directed against the Canadians on the left,
which was vigorously responded to, seemed to indicate an attack
in that direction, but by the time the 1st Battalion was relieved
no move on the part of the enemy had taken place. After two days'
rest at Blaireville the 1st Battalion returned to the trenches at
Boisleux-au-Mont, where the line was singularly quiet. Early on the
5th a desultory bombardment commenced on our front line, but only
with shells of light calibre. Later the railway station came under
fire from the heavy guns, but by 9 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> all was quiet again,
and no more shells were sent over by the enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span> that day. Although
infinite trouble had been taken to conceal Battalion Headquarters, a
big flight of hostile aeroplanes flying low was able to locate it, and
the enemy made some very accurate shooting. On the 8th the enemy began
a gas bombardment, and obtained several direct hits on the entrance
to the Battalion Headquarters dug-out and on two Lewis-gun posts.
A new gas containing ether, which gave off little or no smell, was
used by the enemy, and accounted for a large number of the Battalion
Staff. After two more days' rest at Blaireville, the 1st Battalion
returned to the trenches, where, although the shelling was light, the
enemy's aircraft was very active, often flying low and firing into the
trenches. Patrols were sent out along the whole frontage on the night
of the 11th, and one under Second Lieutenant R. Holmes and Sergeant
Brown failed to return. Little, however, was seen of the enemy,
although a wiring party was encountered once, and another time the
Germans could be heard demolishing a hut near the main Arras&mdash;Bapaume
road. The next day the enemy occasionally fired with the Minenwerfer,
but there was no shelling to speak of. In the evening Lieutenant R.
Holmes and his patrol returned, having been cut off on the previous
night by very strong parties of the enemy. Finding they were unable
to regain our lines, they hid in shell-holes throughout the day, and
took advantage of the darkness when night came to get back. On the
14th, when the usual patrols went out, Second Lieutenant W. Fleet
took out a strong party to visit a German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span> machine-gun post, which
had come under the observation of a patrol on the previous night.
Approaching it with caution, he found that it was unoccupied, but a
German rifle, which he brought back, seemed to show that the enemy
had been there lately. Four escaped British prisoners, who had been
captured on the 21st, re-entered our lines near the sunken road; they
belonged to the Sixth Division. The 1st Battalion went for ten days'
rest to Barly until the 24th, when they marched to Bienvillers-au-Bois
on their way to the trenches. Lieutenant Tindal-Atkinson and Second
Lieutenant Paget-Cooke, who had just arrived to join the Battalion,
were wounded by a shell that fell in No. 4 Company Mess. On the night
of the 27th the 1st Battalion returned to the front line of trenches,
but the Germans were singularly inactive except for occasional bursts
of shell-fire. The patrols that were sent out failed to encounter
any German parties, but one discovered that Calcutta Trench had been
recently occupied by the enemy. Signs of its recent occupation were
found in the shape of fresh bombs, rifles, etc., and a corporal's
greatcoat proved that the occupants had belonged to the 453rd Regiment.
Traces of German occupation could be seen all over the ground, but the
most recent was the line of newly dug posts about 80 yards west of the
Ablainzeville&mdash;Ayette road. The enemy evidently occupied an advanced
picket line, as individual heads could be seen on the low ground, and
the rapidity with which his light machine-guns and snipers opened fire
from various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span> points confirmed this surmise. On the 29th the enemy
still remained inactive, and never engaged any targets which offered
themselves. In the evening snipers were sent out from our lines to
positions, where they could observe and engage any movement on the
part of the enemy, who could be seen advancing in groups of two to
occupy shell-slits. Parties were dribbled forward by the King's and
No. 2 Companies, and told to occupy any empty enemy-slits, to check
any advance of the enemy. These moves and countermoves continued up to
9 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, when Lord Gort decided to withdraw all the advanced
posts, and patrols continued to reconnoitre throughout the night.</p>

<div class="sidenote">May.</div>

<p>The enemy's attitude during May was purely defensive, and except
for two half-hearted raids he showed no inclination to come west of
the line of the Ablainzeville&mdash;Ayette road. The Germans apparently
were occupying an outpost line from Ablainzeville to Ayette, with a
shell-hole line in rear and a line of resistance again behind that,
and the situation depended very much on what was going on in other
parts of the line: if the enemy succeeded in driving back the troops to
the north and south, a retirement would become necessary, even without
any movement of the hostile troops in front.</p>

<p>During the whole month the 1st Battalion remained either in the front
trenches or in reserve. When in the trenches one and a half Companies
held the front line, and one and a half Companies were in support,
with one Company in reserve. On the days they became the Reserve
Battalion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span> they were simply targets for the German artillery; every
day there were casualties, and the number of men killed, wounded,
and gassed amounted to a good many during the month. On some days
the enemy activity was very slight, and on others the shelling would
become intense. Patrols under officers were sent out every night, and
the information gained varied. Occasionally bodies of Germans would
be reported, moving about and talking, but when no attack developed
such movements ceased to have any significance. The back areas were
shelled with gas-shells daily, and so it happened that the casualties,
when the Battalion was in reserve, were often greater than when it was
in the front line. On the 17th the area occupied by the 1st Battalion
was subjected to a severe bombing by aircraft; Second Lieutenant W.
A. Fleet and Second Lieutenant G. E. A. A. Fitz-George Hamilton were
killed, and Second Lieutenant S. J. Hargreaves and Second Lieutenant G.
D. Neale were seriously wounded. The two latter never recovered from
the wounds they received, and died the next day. The loss of these four
keen young officers was deeply felt by the whole Battalion. At the
same time Sergeant Robshaw and Lance-Sergeant Nicholson, the Lewis-gun
instructors, were wounded and buried by the walls of a house, which
were blown in by a bomb on the top of them. On the 20th the Cojeul
Valley was bombarded with gas-shells, and Captain O. Stein, Second
Lieutenant R. Holmes, and Second Lieutenant C. Brutton were gassed. A
few days of rain and mist were welcomed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span> every one, since it made
observation impossible, and therefore the enemy's artillery had to
content itself with a small amount of inaccurate shelling. On the 24th
Second Lieutenant O. W. D. Smith was seriously wounded by a shell. On
the 28th a German propaganda balloon was shot down near Quesnoy Farm;
it contained copies of the <i>Gazette des Ardennes</i>, a French newspaper,
edited by the Germans. Although enemy transport activity could be often
distinctly heard, the impending offensive never developed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">June.</div>

<p>Much the same programme was followed at the beginning of June, and
without any definite movement the enemy continued to bombard both the
front trenches and the back area. On the 5th the Germans were located
by a patrol, working on the road, and Stokes mortars were turned on to
them, with the result that Véry lights went up in quick succession, no
doubt an appeal for assistance. The guns on both sides were continually
busy both day and night, and a great many shells of various sorts must
have been fired. On the 8th the Battalion retired for a rest to Barly,
where it remained until the end of the month.</p>

<div class="sidenote">April.</div>

<p>On the night of April 3 the Thirty-second Division captured Ayette,
which considerably eased the situation on the right flank of the
Guards Division. The 2nd Battalion went up into the line, and found
the trenches very wet. On the 4th, during a heavy shelling, which was
entirely directed against No. 1 Company on the right, Lieutenant the
Hon. H. F. P. Lubbock was killed by a shell which pitched in the trench.</p>

<p>This was a great loss to the Battalion, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span> he was an officer of sound
judgment, who did not know what fear was. Corporal Teague, M.M., was
killed at the same time, and 6 men were wounded. The 7th and 8th were
spent in a camp behind Blaireville and Heudecourt, when Lieutenant F.
H. J. Drummond and Second Lieutenant G. F. Lawrence joined. After two
more days in the trenches the 2nd Battalion retired to Saulty, where
they remained training till the 24th. On the 14th Second Lieutenant
J. A. Paton and Second Lieutenant C. A. Fitch arrived from the
Reinforcement Battalion, and on the 20th Second Lieutenant C. Gwyer
joined.</p>

<p>On the 24th the 2nd Battalion proceeded in buses to
Bienvillers-au-Bois, to relieve the 15th Battalion Highland Light
Infantry, in reserve west of Douchy-les-Ayette. Two companies were
billeted in the old German line just west of Monchy-au-Bois, and the
remainder were in trenches between Douchy-les-Ayette and Monchy. The
following day the Battalion moved up into the front line on the eastern
outskirts of Ayette, and found everything very quiet. The explanation
seemed to be that the Germans were thinning out their troops in this
district, in order to increase their forces available for the thrust
forward north on the night of the 29th. Second Lieutenant C. A. Fitch,
who had gone out with a patrol to reconnoitre the German lines, was
wounded in the head and right arm by a bomb thrown from a German post.</p>

<div class="sidenote">May.</div>

<p>The same routine was carried out all during May: five days in the front
line with inter-company relief, followed by two days in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span> reserve at
Monchy-au-Bois. On the 4th an American Company Commander and three
N.C.O.'s were attached to the 2nd Battalion under instruction. In
order to ensure that the junior officers were proficient in technical
subjects, special lectures were given by Officers from different
branches of the service, and were attended by Officers and N.C.O.'s
of the Battalion when it was in reserve. On the 11th Lieutenant J.
C. Cornforth arrived, and on the 19th Lieutenant C. A. Gordon and
Lieutenant H. A. Finch joined the Battalion. On the 22nd, during a
heavy bombardment which was directed on the front line, Lieutenant
A. W. Acland, M.C., was wounded, and almost every day there were
casualties amongst other ranks. The exact spot the enemy would select
for their next thrust was naturally not known, and a determined attack
was expected daily, but except for intense shelling the enemy showed
no signs of life. On the 27th the shelling increased, and the enemy
aircraft became very active, with the result that there were 9 men
killed and 8 wounded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">June.</div>

<p>The first week in June was spent by the 2nd Battalion in the front
line, where the shells continued to fall with monotonous regularity.
On the 3rd Lieutenant R. M. Oliver joined the Battalion. On the 6th,
after a relief, rendered difficult by the enemy's barrage, which had
been put down on the tracks leading to the trenches, the 2nd Battalion
proceeded to Saulty, where they were billeted in the village and
the Château grounds. There they remained till the end of the month,
training, carrying out tactical schemes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span> and learning the latest
developments in bombing. Colonel Rasch organised a platoon competition
in the following: bomb-throwing, rifle-bombing, message-carrying by
platoon runners, stretcher-bearer competitions, bayonet-fighting,
Lewis-gunnery, musketry, tactical scheme and drill. The tactical scheme
was judged by the two other Commanding Officers in the Brigade, and the
drill by the three Regimental Sergeant-Majors. No. 7 Platoon, under
Lieutenant Palmer, was the winner; No. 16 Platoon, under Sergeant
Taylor, second; and No. 4 Platoon, under Second Lieutenant Bevan,
third. At the Divisional Horse Show, which took place on the 22nd,
the 2nd Battalion won Major-General Feilding's Cup, and Lieutenant G.
Vereker, the Transport Officer, was congratulated on his horses having
proved themselves the best in the Division. On the 23rd Lieutenant N.
McK. Jesper, Lieutenant L. St. L. Hermon-Hodge, and Second Lieutenant
F. J. Langley rejoined the Battalion, and in the absence of Colonel
Rasch, who had gone temporarily to command the Brigade, Captain
Harcourt-Vernon took over the command of the Battalion. On the 29th a
Guard of Honour for H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught, under the command
of Captain Browning, went in buses to the Third Army Headquarters
at Hesdin, where their smart appearance created a great impression.
Onlookers refused to believe that the men had just come out of the
line, and maintained that they had been sent out from England for
the purpose. The following day, the Army Commander, General Sir
Julian Byng, in a message addressed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span> Division, expressed the
satisfaction at their smart appearance, and added that their turn-out
and bearing, their marching and handling of arms, were beyond all
criticism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">April.</div>

<p>The 3rd Battalion spent the whole month of April either in the
trenches, with three Companies in the front line, or in reserve. On
the 7th Lieutenant E. G. A. Fitzgerald was wounded, and on the 8th
the following officers joined the Battalion: Lieutenant F. A. Magnay,
Second Lieutenant R. K. Henderson, Lieutenant C. Clifton Brown, and
Second Lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span> H. W. Sanderson. The days spent in the front
trenches were remarkably quiet, but as the ground on which these
trenches were dug was overlooked by the enemy, very little work could
be done except wiring, and this at night. On the 14th the Battalion,
having "embussed" at Ransart, proceeded <i>via</i> Beaumetz-les-Loges to
Lakerlière and Larbret, where it was billeted. On the 17th drafts
reached the Battalion with the following officers: Second Lieutenant E.
L. F. Clough-Taylor, Second Lieutenant R. Delacombe, Second Lieutenant
W. B. L. Manley, Second Lieutenant H. J. Gibbon, and Second Lieutenant
R. C. G. de Reuter. The days spent in billets were taken up with
training, but as the men had to remain ready to move at one hour's
notice in the morning and three hours' notice in the afternoon, it
was impossible for Companies to go far. An attack from the enemy was
expected on the 21st, and additional precautions were taken, but the
Battalion was not called upon to go up into the front line. Major Lord
Lascelles was appointed Second in Command <i>vice</i> Major Cavendish, and
as Lieut.-Colonel Thorne had to take temporary command of the Brigade,
he had at once to command the Battalion. Companies were now organised
into three platoons with the headquarters of a fourth or depot platoon,
to which all details were attached, when the Battalion went into
action. On the 24th Lieut.-Colonel Thorne returned to the Battalion,
and took it up into the front line the following day. On the 27th the
front posts were subjected to an unusually heavy shelling, during
which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span> Second Lieutenant C. L. F. Boughey was wounded, and there were
6 killed and 5 wounded among other ranks. On the following day the
Battalion retired into Brigade Reserve, where it remained till the end
of the month.</p>

<div class="sidenote">May.</div>

<p>During the first week in May the Battalion remained in the line,
with an inter-company relief, Major Lord Lascelles taking turns with
Lieut.-Colonel Thorne. On the 3rd Second Lieutenant R. P. Papillon
and Lieutenant the Hon. M. H. E. C. Towneley-Bertie joined. Officers'
patrols were sent out every night and in the early morning, to lie
out and listen for any hostile movement. After three days' rest the
Battalion returned to the trenches, and came in for much shelling.
Our artillery carried out nightly a harassing fire on the enemy's
tracks, roads, and possible assembly areas, and this naturally brought
down considerable retaliation. Lieutenant the Hon. M. H. E. C.
Towneley-Bertie was wounded, and among other ranks there were 10 killed
and 14 wounded. Another tour of duty in the front line from the 20th to
the 24th caused 2 killed and 25 wounded among other ranks. On the 26th
Captain G. F. R. Hirst, Lieutenant E. R. M. Fryer, M.C., and Second
Lieutenant J. Chapman joined the Battalion. On the 28th the Battalion
returned to the front trenches, and again came in for a harassing fire.
Inter-company reliefs were carried out, and the work was concentrated
on shelters and the deepening of lateral communication trenches.</p>

<div class="sidenote">June.</div>

<p>The Battalion remained in the front line until June 3, and was
constantly bombarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span> with Blue Cross gas-shells. On the 2nd Lieutenant
G. M. Cornish, M.C., joined. After four days spent in reserve the
Battalion retired to La Baseque, where the men were either billeted
in the farms, or placed in tents and shelters in the wood. There they
remained until the end of the month, training and practising tactical
schemes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<p class="center p-left sm">APRIL 1-14, 1918</p>

<p class="center p-left smcap">The 4th Battalion</p>


<div class="sidenote">4th Batt. April 1-14, 1918.</div>

<p>In April 1918 it fell to the lot of the 4th Guards Brigade to take part
in some of the fiercest fighting of the war.</p>

<p>Ludendorff had opened a concentrated attack with nine divisions on
the line north of La Bassée, and General von Quast, who commanded the
German forces, had penetrated the portion of the line held by the
Portuguese, and gained a considerable amount of ground. Reinforced by
General von Arnim's infantry, he pushed on in the hope of gaining the
Channel ports, or, at the least, of cutting the British communications.
The German masses were pressing forward, and the general situation
became more and more critical.</p>

<p>The attack commenced on April 9, and the Fifteenth Corps, under
Lieut.-General Sir J. P. du Cane, which had been driven back, was
holding the line between Merville and Vieux Berquin, south-east of
Hazebrouck. Although the troops in Merville held fast, the enemy broke
through at Robermetz, and, after capturing Neuf Berquin, moved down the
road to Vierhoek.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Such was the state of affairs, when the 4th Guards Brigade was sent
for to restore the line. After having "debussed" at Strazeele, it
marched towards Vieux Berquin on the evening of April 11. Next day
Brigadier-General the Hon. L. J. P. Butler received orders to attack
Vierhoek, Pont Rondin, and Les Puresbecques, but before he could make
much headway, was himself in turn vigorously engaged by the enemy.
Reinforcements were being hurried up from several quarters, but
everything depended on whether the line would hold. If the Australian
Division, which was being sent up from the rear, could have time to
detrain and take up good positions, the German rush would be checked.
But should the enemy break through far enough to dislocate this
arrangement, matters would become serious.</p>

<p>Realising the gravity of the crisis, General de Lisle, commanding
the Fifteenth Corps, issued an order that no retirement must be made
without an order in writing, signed by a responsible officer, who must
be prepared to justify his action before a court-martial. Every inch
of ground was to be disputed, and every company was told to stand firm
until reinforcements could arrive.</p>

<p>The Battalion was in billets at Villers Brulin on April 10, when
Lieut.-Colonel Pilcher received orders to move up in omnibuses to
Strazeele Station <i>via</i> St. Pol. According to instructions it should
have started "embussing" at 11.30 that night, but owing to some mistake
the buses were twelve hours late, and all ranks spent the night and
half the next day waiting by the roadside. It was impossible to cook
any proper breakfasts, and too cold to sleep, so that when at last
a start was made the men were already tired out. Then for twelve
hours they jolted along in the buses, terribly cramped and without
any opportunity for real rest. When it arrived at its destination
next day, the Battalion marched to a field near Le Paradis, where
Brigadier-General Butler held a conference. There were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span> to be two
battalions in the front line and one in reserve; on the right was
the 3rd Battalion Coldstream which was to take up a position from
L'Epinette to Le Cornet Perdu. The 4th Battalion Grenadiers would be on
the left, and the 2nd Battalion Irish Guards in reserve.</p>

<div class="sidenote">April 12.</div>

<p>Marching off at once, the whole force reached its position about dawn
on the 12th. So promptly was the movement carried out that there was no
time to issue rations, and the food had to follow on later in limbers.
There was also a considerable shortage of tools, with the result that
when daylight came the men were still very inadequately dug-in. In the
4th Battalion, No. 1 Company, under Captain H. Sloane-Stanley, was on
the right, No. 4, under Lieutenant Green, in the centre, and No. 2,
under Captain Pryce, on the left, with No. 3, under Lieutenant Nash,
in support. As soon as it was light the enemy opened a heavy fire
along the whole front with field-guns, while they swept with their
lighter field-guns and machine-guns all places where they detected
any movement. Battalion Headquarters seemed to come in for special
attention, and, whenever any one went in or out, it was the signal for
a shower of shells to fall round the spot.</p>

<p>An order came to Brigadier-General Butler to secure the line from the
College to Vieux Moulin with his brigade, and to prevent any movements
along the Merville&mdash;Neuf Berquin road. He accordingly went up to
Battalion Headquarters, and ordered an advance at 11 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>
At the same time he sent up two companies of the Irish Guards to
advance in échelon behind the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span> flank, in the hope of getting
in touch with the Fiftieth Division. In the 4th Battalion Captain H.
Sloane-Stanley was told to push forward two platoons to seize Vierhoek,
and Captain Pryce to occupy Pont Rondin with a similar force.</p>

<p>The attack started at 11 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, but the Coldstream encountered
such strenuous opposition that they were unable to advance more than
100 yards. Nor could No. 1 Company of the 4th Battalion Grenadiers
make much headway towards Vierhoek, owing to the intense and accurate
machine-gun and artillery fire, which swept the only road over the
stream; and it suffered severely in its attempts to carry out the
orders. Second Lieutenant Osborne, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span> had managed to push on
about 200 yards with his platoon when he was wounded. But No. 2 Company
made a most skilful advance towards Pont Rondin, led by Captain Pryce
himself.</p>

<p>In the houses down the road, by which the Grenadiers had to come,
the Germans were posted with light machine-guns, and before any
progress could be made these houses had to be cleared. Slowly and
systematically, No. 2 Company worked from house to house, and silenced
the machine-guns. Thirty Germans were killed in this way&mdash;Captain Pryce
alone accounted for seven&mdash;and were found afterwards in the houses or
near by. Two machine-guns were taken, as well as a couple of prisoners.</p>

<p>During the whole operation, this company was under heavy fire, not only
from machine-guns but also from a battery of field-guns, which was
firing with open sights from a position some 300 yards down the road.
It was a remarkably fine performance, and was watched with intense
interest from Battalion Headquarters, which were some 200 yards in rear
of the centre of the line, in a position from which the commanding
officer could see most of the trenches occupied by his battalion.
Lieutenant Nash, who had brought up one platoon to support No. 2
Company, was on his way back when his hand was carried away by a shell,
and the command of No. 3 Company devolved on Lieutenant M. D. Thomas.</p>

<p>About 3 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> the situation of the 4th Guards Brigade became
very critical. On the right the Coldstream reported that there was no
sign of the Fiftieth Division, which should have been on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span> their right
flank, and at the same time Captain Pryce sent back word that his left
flank was in the air, and that Germans could be seen 1000 yards in rear
of his company. He added that he was being engaged by trench mortars
and field-guns, which were firing at him with open sights from the
exposed flank.</p>

<p>Affairs on the right were improved by the arrival of a company of the
Irish Guards, which, without orders, undertook a counter-attack in
conjunction with a company of the Coldstream. But, having no troops to
send up on the left flank, Brigadier-General Butler decided that that
portion of the line must be withdrawn. Accordingly, Lieut.-Colonel
Pilcher ordered Captain Pryce to fall back, but even then there was
a large gap between his company and the troops on the left flank,
of which the Germans took advantage. Having reached the position
indicated, Captain Pryce held on to it in spite of several determined
attacks by the enemy. Colonel Pilcher, accompanied by the Adjutant,
Captain Gerard, visited the left of the line about 4.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>
He found No. 2 Company rather scattered, as it had been compelled
to form a defensive flank. Meanwhile, after an intense artillery
preparation, the enemy attacked No. 1 and No. 4 Companies, and was
driven back with severe losses.</p>

<p>All day the Battalion Headquarters were severely shelled by two German
field-guns and also by trench mortars. The farm they occupied was set
on fire, and both Captain M. Chapman, who had distinguished himself on
many occasions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span> as intelligence officer, and Lieutenant N. R. Abbey,
who was attached to Battalion Headquarters, were killed by shells.
A good many valuable men, who had served on Battalion Headquarters
for a long time, were killed or wounded during the day. The farm was
full of cows and horses, which had to be turned loose when the farm
caught fire, and several casualties took place on this account. The
Headquarters were afterwards moved to the garden of the farm. To some
extent the fire was kept down by the skilful and gallant conduct of
Lieutenant Lewis of the 152nd Brigade R.F.A., who exposed himself
continually to get direct observation, while his guns undoubtedly
inflicted heavy casualties on the advancing Germans.</p>

<p>At the close of the day, the front of the 4th Battalion remained
intact, but the cost of holding this line against repeated assaults had
necessarily been very heavy. No. 2 Company lost 80 men and 1 officer
out of 120 who went into action, and No. 4 Company lost 70 per cent
of its strength and all the officers. The total casualties in the
Battalion were 250, including 8 officers. On the other hand, the enemy
lost so heavily that the ground in front of the Battalion was strewn
with their dead; in some places there were heaps of bodies piled up in
front of the trenches. Some idea of the fierceness of the fighting may
be gathered from the fact that during the day the 4th Battalion alone
fired off no less than 70,000 rounds of ammunition.</p>

<p>In view of the situation on both flanks, Brigadier-General Butler gave
orders on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span> night of the 12th that the Brigade was to take up a new
line. For this the 2nd Battalion Irish Guards was to have its right
resting on Pont Tournant, with the 3rd Battalion Coldstream in the
centre, and the 4th Battalion Grenadiers on the left, in touch with the
12th Battalion K.O.Y.L.I., which was to join up with the troops of the
Twenty-ninth Division. In response to General Butler's request that the
line held by his brigade might be contracted, the Fifth Division was
ordered to take over the line as far as L'Epinette inclusive.</p>

<p>As soon as this relief was completed, the 2nd Battalion Irish Guards
and one company of the Coldstream were withdrawn into Brigade Reserve,
and the 210th Field Company R.E. went up, to help the 4th Battalion
Grenadiers dig the new line. To replace some of the losses in the
Battalion, Captain Minchin, Lieutenant Lyon, and Lieutenant Burt were
sent up, and Lieutenant Murray-Lawes went to Battalion Headquarters.
Colonel Pilcher's orders were to delay the enemy at all costs, so as to
give the Australian Division time to detrain and come up to that part
of the line.</p>

<p>The new Battalion frontage was 1800 yards long; the country was
absolutely flat, with not a single hedge to mask the trenches, and
the line was held by companies in isolated posts. So heavily had the
Battalion suffered in the fighting on the 12th that it had only 9
officers and 180 other ranks left&mdash;that is to say, one man to every ten
yards of front.</p>

<p>As the Battalion Headquarters had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span> destroyed, Colonel Pilcher
assembled the newly-arrived officers at the Irish Guards Headquarters,
and explained to them that the new line was to be dug east of the Vieux
Berquin&mdash;Neuf Berquin road, so that the village of La Couronne and
the cross-roads south of it might be protected. When Captain Minchin
reached the leading companies, Captain Pryce told him the men were so
dead beat that he thought they were quite incapable of digging a new
line, and the Adjutant of the K.O.Y.L.I. said his men were in much the
same condition. When this was reported to Colonel Pilcher, he went up
himself to explain how things stood. He could find no trace of the
machine-guns from the Thirty-first Division, which should have been
there. The Germans were so close that they could be heard talking quite
distinctly. He found Captain Pryce, who was quite worn out from want
of sleep, and made it clear that the orders must be carried out, as it
was absolutely essential to alter the position of the trenches. The
plans had been changed, and the line the Battalion was now to occupy
lay between La Couronne and the burnt farm, that had been the Battalion
Headquarters.</p>

<p>The men were awakened with difficulty, and led to the new position,
where, exhausted as they were, they were set to dig themselves in.
Having satisfied himself that the orders were understood, Colonel
Pilcher went in search of Captain Minchin, but failed to find him in
the dark. The field company of R.E., that was to have been sent up
to help, did not appear, and as there were only 14 men left in No. 4
Company,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span> and 30 in No. 2, a continuous line of trenches was out of the
question. Captain Minchin, therefore, ordered them to dig rifle-pits,
capable of holding three or four men at intervals, and even so there
were gaps of considerable length between companies. So utterly weary
were the men that it was not at all easy to make them understand what
had to be done, and naturally the darkness did not help to simplify
matters. No. 1 Company, under Captain H. Sloane-Stanley, had gone too
far to the right, and instead of being up to the burnt farm was some
200 yards away. This made it necessary to post a strong sentry group,
where it could guard the gap.</p>

<p>It was nearly dawn before the digging was finished; one man in each bay
then took turns to watch while the other three slept. One source of
constant anxiety to the officers was the ammunition, which had not been
sent up. Just before dawn Lieutenant Lyon received a message that it
had been dumped near La Couronne, but as it was then getting light he
could not send men for it. Captain Pryce, however, succeeded in getting
five boxes before daylight.</p>

<div class="sidenote">April 13.</div>

<p>Fog hung thickly round during the early morning of the 13th, and
it was found that the Germans had taken advantage of it to work up
machine-guns close to our line. Their first attack occurred at 6.30,
and was directed against the 3rd Battalion Coldstream. With the aid of
a tank, the enemy forced his way between the left and centre companies
of the Coldstream, but was soon ejected. A company of the 2nd Battalion
Irish Guards went up later to strengthen <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>that part of the line. At
9.15 Colonel Pilcher found that strong German attacks were developing
all down the line, and sent orders round to the companies that they
must hold on to their line at all costs, and fight to the end. This
message was duly acknowledged by all officers commanding companies.</p>

     <p class="p0 center p-left"><i>Position on April 13, 1918.</i></p>
  </div>

<p class="p2">As soon as the mist cleared away, the Germans opened fire with their
machine-guns and swept the parapet with bullets. When the light
improved, they brought up more machine-guns, and were able to enfilade
the trenches. Under cover of this fire they crawled forward by ones and
twos, and established sniping posts in some unfinished trenches not
150 yards off. The Brigade-Major came up to Battalion Headquarters,
to confirm the report that the troops on the left had retired, and
that the left was entirely in the air. He had also heard that the
enemy had penetrated the centre of the Brigade. Colonel Pilcher and
the Brigade-Major went down the road to within some 150 yards of La
Couronne, where they met Private Bagshaw (afterwards killed), who
was runner to No. 4 Company, and who reported that the centre was
still intact. After going up close to the front line to verify this
statement, the Brigade-Major returned to inform the Brigadier of what
he had ascertained.</p>

<p>Captain Minchin meanwhile reported the precarious condition of affairs
in front, and was told in reply that a company of Irish Guards and
a platoon of Coldstream would be sent to his assistance, but these
reinforcements never arrived. At one time the Germans seemed to be
con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>templating a determined attack; they stood up and advanced in
extended order, in the hope of finding a gap and penetrating the line,
but the steady fire poured on them by the 4th Battalion soon changed
their minds, and sent them back to cover. About 12.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> the
12th Pioneer Battalion of the K.O.Y.L.I. at La Couronne was completely
blown out of its trenches by the enemy's trench mortars. When the men
of that battalion found that the troops on their left had been pushed
back, and that the Germans were working round in rear of them, they
had no choice but to retire. This placed the left flank of the 4th
Battalion in the air.</p>

<p>Captain Pryce sent back an urgent message saying that the Germans were
in Vieux Berquin and La Couronne, and that another column, estimated at
two battalions, was advancing from Bleu. Up to that point, he added,
he had managed to beat off the enemy, and there was a large number
of their dead in front of his trenches, but he was not strong enough
to resist much longer the repeated assaults of so large a force. As
soon as this message reached General Butler, he sent up the company
of Irish Guards, which had already been promised, but it never got to
Captain Pryce, for by now the Germans had wedged themselves in some
force between him and his hopes of relief. Advancing north of the
road leading to La Couronne, the reinforcing company was met by large
numbers of Germans coming from La Becque. It fought on till it was
completely cut off, and only one sergeant and six men escaped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>An attempt was made to alter the position of a Lewis-gun belonging to
No. 2 Company, but the moment they moved the N.C.O. and the men with it
were fired on, and the gun was disabled. Finding that all attempts to
retrieve the gun were useless, Second Lieutenant Philipps, who was in
charge of the party, decided to rejoin Captain Pryce, but was hit in
the hip by a machine-gun bullet just as he reached the trench.</p>

<p>Their turning of the left flank allowed the Germans to creep round
in rear of the Battalion, but they had not gone far before they were
engaged by the Battalion Headquarters, as well as the 3rd Battalion
Coldstream Headquarters, who offered a most determined resistance.
This final effort kept them successfully at bay until the arrival of
the Australian Division put a final and effective stop to any farther
movements on their part.</p>

<p>There remains the epic story of Captain Pryce. One last message was
received from him&mdash;that his company was surrounded and his men shooting
to front and to rear, standing back to back in the trenches to meet the
encircling enemy at all points.</p>

<p>Of what happened afterwards, an outline at any rate was gathered from a
corporal of the company, who escaped from Vieux Berquin the following
night. Reduced now to only thirty men, the gallant little band fought
on all that day. Without a pause they fired at their advancing foes,
steadily, calmly, with the same rapidity and deadly aim that caused the
Germans in the Mons retreat to mistake our "contemptible"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span> riflemen
for machine-guns. The enemy was puzzled. They could not for a moment
believe that such a stout resistance could be put up by anything but
a formidable force, and dared not make the attempt to come to close
quarters.</p>

<p>By the evening the defenders were practically at the end of their
tether. Only eighteen out of the thirty were left, and they had used
up every scrap of ammunition. The Germans were in Verte Rue, and the
beleaguered band could see the field-grey uniforms advancing towards
Bois d'Aval. It was now 8.15. Suddenly Captain Pryce perceived a new
move against him. A party of the enemy had made up their minds to test
the strength of their obstinate opponents; they pressed forward, and
got to within 80 yards of the stubbornly-held trenches. The position
seemed hopeless, but not for a moment did he flinch. Though the last
cartridge had been fired, the men still had their bayonets, and he
ordered them to charge.</p>

<p>Straight at the advancing enemy he rushed at the head of his handful of
men. The Germans were completely taken aback. They dared not fire, for
fear of hitting their own men, who were now in rear of the Grenadiers'
desperately defended position, and retired. Thereupon Captain Pryce
decided to take his men back to the trench again.</p>

<p>But by now the enemy had seen. They had realised the almost incredible
weakness of the hitherto unknown force, that had so long successfully
kept them at bay. And, restored to confidence, they came on once more.
Once more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span> Captain Pryce led the tattered remnant of his company&mdash;that
now numbered only fourteen&mdash;to the charge, and when last seen they were
still fighting fearlessly and doggedly against overwhelming odds.</p>

<p>In all the glorious record of the Grenadiers there has been no story
more splendid than this. It was a Homeric combat&mdash;two battalions held
up (and the advance of a whole enemy division thus delayed) by a few
determined men. Of the losses they inflicted on their overwhelmingly
superior foe, some idea was gathered by Lieutenant Burt, who when
taken prisoner afterwards was shown by a German officer the heaps of
enemy dead in front of the British trenches. If ever a niche were
earned in the Temple of Fame it was by these brave men and their brave
leader&mdash;who, having already won a bar to his Military Cross, was
awarded the Victoria Cross for this crowning act of gallantry.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, No. 1 and No. 4 Companies, who had been enfiladed all
day, had lost all their officers. Captain H. Sloane-Stanley had been
killed and Captain Minchin wounded in three places, though he just
managed to crawl back afterwards, being fired at all the way. In No. 3
Company Lieutenant Lyon was killed, and subsequently the whole company
was surrounded and taken prisoners. The survivors of No. 1 and No. 4
Companies held on till night, although by then the Germans were in
rear of them, and finally managed to get back to the Australians. The
Headquarters of the Battalion took up a position in the evening just
south of the Forêt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span> de Nieppe, in prolongation of the Australian line.
Although the line had been saved, the whole Brigade had been cut to
pieces. The Coldstream and Irish Guards had suffered the same fate as
the Grenadiers, and few of them got back to the Australian line.</p>

<p>By April 14 the 4th Battalion had been three days and three nights
fighting and digging without any rest, while of the nineteen officers
who went into action only two were left. The casualties were:</p>

<p>Sir Douglas Haig in his Despatch of October 21 describes the fighting
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Next day (April 12) the enemy followed up his attacks
with great vigour, and the troops of the Twenty-ninth and
Thirty-first Divisions, now greatly reduced in strength by
the severe fighting already experienced, and strung out over
a front of nearly 10,000 yards east of the Forêt de Nieppe,
were once more tried to the utmost. Behind them the First
Australian Division, under the command of Major-General Sir H.
B. Walker, K.C.B., D.S.O., was in process of detraining, and
the troops were told that the line was to be held at all costs
until the detrainment could be completed.</p>

<p>During the morning, which was very foggy, several determined
attacks, in which a German armoured car came into action
against the 4th Guards Brigade on the southern portion of
our line, were repulsed with great loss to the enemy. After
the failure of these assaults, he brought up field-guns to
point-blank range, and in the northern sector, with their aid,
gained <i>Vieux Berquin</i>. Everywhere except at <i>Vieux Berquin</i>
the enemy's advance was held up all day by desperate fighting,
in which our advanced posts displayed the greatest gallantry,
maintaining their ground when entirely surrounded, men
standing back to back in the trenches and shooting to front
and rear.</p>

     <p class="p0 center p-left"><i>Brigadier-General C. R. Champion de Crespigny D.S.O.</i></p>
  </div>

<p class="p2">In the afternoon the enemy made a further deter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>mined
effort, and by sheer weight of numbers forced his way through
the gaps in our depleted line, the surviving garrisons of our
posts fighting where they stood to the last with bullet and
bayonet. The heroic resistance of these troops, however, had
given the leading Brigade of the First Australian Division
time to reach and organise their appointed line east of the
<i>Forêt de Nieppe</i>. These now took up the fight, and the way to
<i>Hazebrouck</i> was definitely closed.</p>

<p>The performance of all the troops engaged in this most gallant
stand, and especially that of the 4th Guards Brigade, on
whose front of some 4000 yards the heaviest attacks fell, is
worthy of the highest praise. No more brilliant exploit has
taken place since the opening of the enemy's offensive, though
gallant actions have been without number.</p>

<p>The action of these troops, and indeed of all the Divisions
engaged in the fighting in the Lys Valley, is the more
noteworthy because, as already pointed out, practically the
whole of them had been brought straight out of the Somme
battlefield, where they had suffered severely and had been
subjected to a great strain. All these Divisions, without
adequate rest and filled with young reinforcements, which
they had had no time to assimilate, were again hurriedly
thrown into the fight, and in spite of the great disadvantages
under which they laboured, succeeded in holding up the
advance of greatly superior forces of fresh troops. Such an
accomplishment reflects the greatest credit on the youth of
Great Britain, as well as upon those responsible for the
training of young soldiers sent out from home at this time.</p></blockquote>

<p>Lieutenant C. Kerr of the 8th Battalion Australian Infantry afterwards
reported that, when the Australian Division was establishing a line of
defence for the troops in front to fall back upon, isolated parties
from the front arrived.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span> Sergeant E. Shaw of the 4th Battalion on
reaching that line, collected all the men he could, and inquired where
he should take up a position; but Lieutenant Kerr, who knew what hard
fighting the Battalion had been through, offered to send these men back
to his Battalion Headquarters. Sergeant Shaw, however, asked permission
to stay in the line with his men until he received instructions to
join his battalion. A position behind the hedge near Seclin Farm was
allotted to these men, and there they stayed until the 15th, when they
received orders to join their battalion.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Kerr added in his report:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The men of my company and battalion are full of admiration for
the manner in which the Guards fought. We watched the fighting
in the village and farms whilst consolidating new line. The
moral effect on our troops of the stubborn resistance offered
by these troops in denying ground to the enemy, the orderly
withdrawal to our line, and the refusal of this sergeant
to leave the line when offered the choice of comfortable
quarters, was excellent.</p></blockquote>

<p class="center p-left smcap">The 4th Battalion</p>


<div class="sidenote">4th Batt. April 1918.</div>

<p class="p-left">Lieut.-Colonel Pilcher brought the remnants of the 4th Battalion out
of the line on the 15th, and after halting for a few hours at Grand
Sec Bois, arrived at Borre. The billets into which the Battalion went,
were between Hazebrouck and Borre, and the men were glad to get a rest
after their hard fighting. Captain the Hon. F. E. Needham arrived,
and took over command of No. 1 Company, and Second Lieutenant P. G.
S. Gregson-Ellis, who joined at the same time, was posted to No. 2
Company. The Battalion was now so weak in numbers that Lieut.-Colonel
Pilcher organised it into two companies of three platoons each.
Being in reserve it was still in the area of operations, and on the
16th, while the Germans were shelling the back areas, one shell fell
in one of the billets, killing three men, and wounding five more,
including Company Sergeant-Major Pettit. On the 16th the Battalion
marched to La Kreule, moving on the next day into billets at La Halte.
Brigadier-General Butler found that these sadly depleted battalions
were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span> difficult to work with, since at any time his Brigade might be
called upon to take over a portion of the line, and a battalion of six
platoons would be expected to hold trenches, occupied by a battalion up
to full strength. He therefore determined to make a composite battalion
of the 4th Battalion Grenadiers and the 3rd Battalion Coldstream, and
to place it under the command of Lieut.-Colonel Pilcher, with Major
Gillilan as Second in Command. In all the history of the two regiments
this had never been done before; not even at the first battle of
Ypres, where battalions of each regiment had been decimated, had any
amalgamation been attempted. This composite battalion now took over
from the 5th Battalion of the 2nd Australian Regiment the billets in
Le-Tir-Anglais, and was placed in support. During a severe shelling on
the 20th Second Lieutenant R. D. Richardson was severely wounded, and
died four days later. On the 22nd the composite battalion relieved the
King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry in the front line, and came in for
a heavy bombardment of gas and high-explosive shells from the enemy's
artillery, during which Lieutenant R. Rolfe was killed. After three
days in the trenches the composite battalion moved back into support,
and now that drafts of men had been sent up to both battalions, it was
split up again into two. The officers of the 4th Battalion were:</p>

<p>At the beginning of July the Battalion went to Criel Plage. On the
20th the third anniversary of the formation of the Battalion was duly
celebrated by a football match between the two half battalions, and a
Sergeants' dinner and concert, which Brigadier-General Butler attended.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aug.</div>

<p>During August the Battalion remained at Criel Plage employed in
training and fatigue work. Lieutenant C. C. Cubitt joined.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sept.</div>

<p>At the beginning of September Captain R. Wolrige-Gordon joined, and on
the 25th the Battalion proceeded to Hiermont, where it was placed under
the orders of the Cavalry Corps, as mobile infantry to be moved by
motor transport. On the 27th it moved to Rorcourt, and two days later
to Bray-sur-Somme, where it occupied a camp which had formerly been
used for German prisoners. On the 30th Lieutenant B. Layton, Second
Lieutenant A. G. Snelling, and Second Lieutenant W. R. Wearne arrived.</p>

<p>On October 3 the Battalion moved to Frise, and on the 8th to
P&#339;uilly. Its movements now depended on the Cavalry Corps, but as
there was no scope for the latter, since the country was enclosed
and full of barbed wire, its rôle was to march in the wake of the
divisions, which were driving the Germans in front of them. In order
to be at hand if wanted it was necessary to keep well up, and so the
column was constantly under shell-fire. On leaving P&#339;uilly the
Battalion marched to Bellenglise, moving on the following day to
Montbrehain, where the British lines advancing and the Germans retiring
could be plainly seen. On the 9th Major J. S. Hughes, M.C., arrived
and took up his duties as Second in Command. The march was continued
through Brancourt to Premont, where the main road was completely
blocked, as the retreating Germans had blown down the church, through
Montigny to Gouy, where the Battalion remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span> for three days. The
men had an opportunity of seeing Lesb&#339;ufs and Morval, which had
played so great a part in the battle of the Somme in 1916, and also the
Grenadiers' Memorial erected there. On the 21st Second Lieutenant M.
C. St. J. Hornby joined. On the 26th the 4th Guards Brigade left the
Cavalry Corps and received orders to join the Guards Division. For the
time being the Battalion was sent to its old billets in Criel, where
Lieutenant R. D. Leigh-Pemberton, M.C., and Second Lieutenant O. Scott
Russell joined, and there it remained until the Armistice was signed on
November 11.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

<p class="center p-left sm">JULY AND AUGUST 1918</p>

<p class="center p-left"><i>Diary of the War</i></p>


<div class="sidenote">1918.</div>

<p>After some successes on a small scale by the French at St. Pierre
Aigle, and by the Americans at Château-Thierry, the Germans launched
their third and last offensive on a fifty-mile front in the direction
of Rheims, and penetrated the line to a depth of two to three miles.
Thirty German divisions took part in this battle, and the fighting was
very severe. On July 18 Marshal Foch began his brilliant counter-stroke
on a twenty-seven-mile front from Fontenoy to Belleau, and drove the
Germans back over the Marne, capturing a large number of prisoners.
Although in full retreat, the Germans continued to offer a stubborn
resistance, and counter-attacked all along the line.</p>

<p>In August Sir Douglas Haig struck with the Fourth Army under Sir Henry
Rawlinson, and succeeded in inflicting a crushing defeat on the Germans
and capturing 22,000 prisoners. Hardly had the enemy recovered from
this blow, when the Third Army under Sir Julian Byng advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span> on a
nine-mile front, and recovered a large portion of the ground that had
been lost in the spring.</p>

<p>In Italy the Austrians were completely defeated by the Italians,
who took a large number of prisoners and guns, and the whole Piave
Delta was cleared. These successes were quickly followed up until the
Austrians were in full retreat.</p>

<p>In Albania the Allied Forces made considerable progress and compelled
the Austrians to retire.</p>

<p>In Palestine the British positions covering the passages of the Jordan
and the north of Jericho were attacked by the Turks.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Operations from August 21 to 28</h3>

<p class="center p-left"><i>Divisional Account</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Aug.</div>

<p>After Rawlinson's success on the Somme Byng was ordered to advance,
recover the Arras&mdash;Albert railway, and generally to hustle the Germans,
who were now falling slowly back. This was to be the prelude to the
main operation.</p>

<p>The attack on August 21 was planned and carried out at exceedingly
short notice, and was completely successful. The subsequent daily
attacks, executed in pursuance of the policy laid down by higher
authority, gave the enemy no rest and no opportunity of organising a
new line of resistance, but they rendered the task of coordination with
the division on the flanks almost impossible. By the time the position
of the advanced troops of the Guards Division at the end of the day's
fighting had been ascertained (probably not before 4 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>),
there was usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span> only just time to plan and issue orders for the next
day's operations. It seldom happened that the situation and intention
of the flank divisions could be ascertained before orders were issued,
with the result that each division had to work independently.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aug. 21.</div>

<p>The Guards Division was at that time in the Sixth Corps, which had been
ordered to capture the Ablainzeville&mdash;Moyenneville spur on the morning
of the 21st. The attack was carried out by the Second Division on the
right, followed by the Third Division and 2nd Guards Brigade from the
Guards Division on the left, with the 5th Infantry Brigade from the
Second Division in reserve.</p>

<p>In the 2nd Guards Brigade (Sergison-Brooke) the attack was carried out
by the 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards and 1st Battalion Scots Guards,
with the 3rd Battalion Grenadier Guards in reserve. When the first
objectives had been secured the 3rd Battalion Grenadier Guards was
pushed through, and captured the line of the railway. The attack was
supported by seven brigades of field artillery and heavy guns under
Colonel Phipps. One company of the 4th Battalion Guards Machine Gun
Regiment was attached, and sixteen tanks (Mark IV.) were to co-operate.</p>

<p>The 1st Guards Brigade (with Gort temporarily in command) was ordered
to advance towards the railway, and be prepared to occupy Hamel Switch
in the event of the leading brigade finding it unoccupied. There
was very thick mist in the early morning, and the contact patrols
were unable to work, but the enemy had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span> expected this attack, and
had withdrawn all his guns, leaving only a very small garrison in
the forward area. Moyenneville was secured without difficulty, while
the Second Division captured Courcelles. On reaching the railway the
resistance stiffened; and when General Sergison-Brooke reported that
all the tanks appeared to have been drawn away south-east, and that
there were none operating on the front of the Brigade, Major-General
Feilding warned him that no advance beyond the railway must be
attempted without them. In the meantime the Third Division on the right
had some stiff fighting on the railway, and the Fifty-ninth Division
on the left made some progress towards Boisieux St. Marc. Gort's
Brigade reached the quarries on the other side of the railway in the
afternoon, and found there was heavy hostile shelling from the north
of Courcelles. That night the patrols entered Hamelincourt Trench, and
early the next morning the Germans counter-attacked, but failed to
eject the companies which were occupying Hamel Works.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aug. 22.</div>

<p>On the 22nd orders were issued for a farther advance the next day.
Brigadier-General Sergison-Brooke, in command of the 2nd Guards
Brigade, was instructed to advance. On his left the Third and
Fifty-sixth Divisions would operate, and on his right the Second
Division would capture Gomiecourt. The enemy was to be pressed
continuously in order to conform to the attack by British and French
troops elsewhere. On the 23rd the enemy shelled Boiry with gas and
high-explosive shells, but did not offer any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span> serious resistance.
Sergison-Brooke's 2nd Guards Brigade met with little opposition, and
gained all their objectives along Hamelincourt Trench, capturing Hamel
Mound. Orders were then sent to Brigadier-General Sergison-Brooke to
advance on the line Judas Farm&mdash;St. Leger Mill, while Brigadier-General
Follett was told to move up the 3rd Guards Brigade, and be prepared to
relieve the 2nd Guards Brigade in the evening. Meanwhile the Second
Division had captured Ervillers.</p>

<p>The great feature of the day's fighting was the advance of the 1st
Battalion Grenadier Guards, which had been placed at the disposal of
General Sergison-Brooke. After a long approach march, this Battalion,
advancing with both flanks exposed, passed through Sergison-Brooke's
Brigade, and seized the key-position south-west of St. Leger. The
capture of this position enabled the divisions on both flanks to
advance the following day with little loss.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aug. 23.</div>

<p>That night when the 3rd Guards Brigade relieved the 2nd, the Guards
Division had reached the line running through Mory Switch as far as
Judas Trench, thence to Judas Farm, and on to Boyelles Reserve, where
it was in touch with the Fifty-sixth Division.</p>

<p>The next morning&mdash;the 24th&mdash;the 3rd Guards Brigade continued the
pursuit of the Germans, and was ordered to advance on St. Leger, which
was not to be entered by the battalions engaged in the attack, as the
battalion in reserve would be responsible for the "mopping up" of the
town. This advance was successfully accom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>plished, but after St. Leger
had been secured, it was found impossible to make any further progress
until Mory Copse was cleared. The Second Division was accordingly
ordered to take and hold Mory Copse, while the 3rd Guards Brigade was
to push forward at once, and conform to the general advance. As soon as
Mory and Mory Copse had been secured, the Second Division advanced on
Behagnies and Sapignies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aug. 25.</div>

<p>The attack continued on the 25th, and the Guards Division advanced
towards Ecouste and Longatte <i>via</i> Bank's Trench and Bank's Reserve,
while the Fifty-sixth Division tried to gain the Hindenburg
support line. The occupation of Behagnies and part of Sapignies
was successfully accomplished by the Second Division on the right.
Follett's 3rd Guards Brigade advanced supported by tanks, but these
were quickly put out of action by the anti-tank rifles of the Germans.
Considerable resistance was met with in Leger Wood, and there was heavy
hostile machine-gun fire from Croisilles. The 1st Battalion Grenadier
Guards made a wonderfully fine advance on the right of the Brigade,
but was strongly counter-attacked and suffered heavy casualties. The
Sixty-second Division was unable to capture Mory on account of the
division on its right being held up; later in the evening it succeeded
in reaching Camouflage Copse. That night De Crespigny's 1st Guards
Brigade relieved the 3rd Guards Brigade.</p>

<p>The following day orders for a further attack were issued. The advance
was to be continued by the Sixty-second, Fifty-sixth, and Guards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Divisions, the latter directed on high ground north and south of
Ecouste and Longatte, while the Fifty-sixth Division was to envelop
Croisilles, moving down the Hindenburg line. The advance was not to be
pressed if strong resistance was encountered. The 1st Guards Brigade
was to advance under barrage in a line from Croisilles Copse to the
Crucifix, and the heavy artillery was to concentrate on Sensee Valley.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aug. 27.</div>

<p>Early on the 27th the Sixty-second Division captured Bank's Trench,
and De Crespigny's Brigade reached Burnhill Trench. Here the 2nd
Battalion Grenadier Guards was held up by heavy machine-gun fire, while
the 2nd Battalion Coldstream Guards was counter-attacked from both
flanks, and driven back to the line of Leger Reserve&mdash;Bank's Trench.
The Fifty-sixth Division was also in difficulties, and could make no
headway against the machine-gun fire from Croisilles. The situation
as regards the Guards Division was as follows: On the right the 2nd
Battalion Grenadier Guards was in touch with the Sixty-second Division
on the ridge south-west of L'Homme Mort, the line then reaching a
sunken road leading to St. Leger. There were some men in Bank's Trench,
but there were also isolated parties of the enemy still there, which
made reorganisation impossible until dark. Major-General Feilding sent
orders to Brigadier-General de Crespigny to reorganise the battalions
in front, and to endeavour to secure the line from Bank's Trench to
Leger Reserve. If it was found that the Germans had withdrawn, the 76th
Brigade was to pass through the 1st Guards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span> Brigade and follow them
up. During the night Bank's Trench was cleared of Germans, and 150
prisoners were taken.</p>

<p>On the 28th De Crespigny's Brigade was holding a line along Mory
Switch&mdash;Bank's Trench and St. Leger Reserve, and the enemy was reported
to have withdrawn to Longatte support. At mid-day the Fifty-sixth
Division captured Croisilles, and continued its advance towards
Bullecourt. The whole of Bank's Trench up to the Mory&mdash;Ecoust road had
now fallen into the hands of De Crespigny's Brigade, and patrols had
been sent out some way in front. During the day the Germans withdrew
towards Ecoust and Bullecourt, followed by our patrols. Orders were
given for this brigade to be relieved by the 76th Infantry Brigade,
and to retire to the area between the Arras&mdash;Bapaume road and the
Arras&mdash;Albert railway.</p>

<p>The total number of prisoners taken by the Division from the 21st to
the 29th was 30 officers, and 1479 other ranks.</p>

<p>The casualties were: Killed, 28 officers, 278 other ranks; wounded, 58
officers, 1675 other ranks; missing, 3 officers, 239 other ranks.</p>

<p>After six days spent at Barly, the 1st Battalion marched to
Bavincourt, where it entrained for Blaireville. On arrival the men
were provided with tea and cigarettes by the Thirty-second Division,
and the Battalion took over trench shelters from the 2nd Battalion
Manchester Regiment, whose Adjutant was Captain Kaye, formerly a
sergeant in the King's Company, and whose Second in Command was Major
Marshall, late Irish Guards. On the 10th the Battalion relieved the
2nd Battalion Scots Guards, which was the battalion in support, and
some high-velocity shells fell in its area, wounding three men. On
the 14th the Battalion moved up to the front line, which had become
very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span> slippery owing to the heavy rainstorms, and the ground was so
deep in mud in some places that the relief was not completed till 2
<span class="smcap">A.M.</span> The enemy was quiet on the whole, but some movement
was observed round Boyelles. The following day the Germans showed
an inclination to push machine-guns forward on the south side of
the railway in order to get close to our lines. Hostile aircraft
was more active, but was kept well in hand, and in the evening two
German aeroplanes were brought down near Hamelincourt. On the 19th
the Battalion was relieved, and retired to the reserve line trenches.
The period spent in reserve was uneventful, but on the 27th, when
the Battalion had moved up in support, the Germans carried out a
concentrated gas bombardment of the area Boisleux-au-Mont village and
station, and eight men in No. 4 Company were gassed. On the 30th Second
Lieutenant J. L. Campbell, Company Sergeant-Major Frost, and two men
were wounded during some severe shelling. The former recovered, but
Sergeant-Major Frost succumbed to the wounds he had received, and died
that evening. On the 31st six platoons from the 320th Regiment of the
American Army, in addition to the Second in Command and the Lewis-gun
officer, were attached to the Battalion. The enemy's artillery that
evening showed an increased activity, and put down a destructive
barrage which lasted for three hours.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aug.</div>

<p>From the 1st to the 6th of August the 1st Battalion was in the front
line at Boisleux-au-Mont, where, except for intermittent shelling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
everything was unusually quiet. During one of the periods of shelling
Lieutenant G. Hughes was severely wounded, and died in the evening.
There were 2 men killed and 11 wounded, in addition to two of the
American troops. On the 6th the Battalion returned to the reserve
trenches at Blaireville, where it remained until the 15th. In the
absence of Brigadier-General de Crespigny, Lord Gort assumed temporary
command of the 1st Guards Brigade, and Major Bailey commanded the
Battalion. On the 21st Sergison-Brooke's Brigade attacked in a thick
mist on the right of the 3rd Guards Brigade, and the Germans put down
a heavy barrage of shells and Minenwerfer on the trenches occupied by
the 1st Battalion. The mist rendered smoke-bombs useless, and a patrol
was sent out to get touch with the enemy, who was expected to retire.
Lieutenant Hawkesworth with nine men entered Marc trench supported by
a platoon from No. 3 Company, and captured two Germans; a strong party
of the enemy which tried to recapture them, was beaten off with several
men killed. On the 22nd the Battalion was relieved, and proceeded to
Boiry St. Martin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aug. 23.</div>

<p>In accordance with General Follett's order, the 2nd Battalion Scots
Guards and 1st Battalion Welsh Guards moved to the low ground east of
Ayette, while the 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards was ordered to send
an officer to Brigade Headquarters. Lieutenant Hawkesworth, who was
selected for this duty, sent back word that the Battalion was to be
ready to march at once. At 12.50 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> Major Bailey received
orders to move<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span> up his Battalion to the east of Moyenneville, and
to report to Sergison-Brooke's Brigade as soon as he arrived there.
Accordingly the Battalion marched off, and reached its destination
about 3.15 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> There was no time to issue written orders,
and General Sergison-Brooke was able to explain only verbally to Major
Bailey the objective of the Battalion. Having summoned his Company
Commanders, Major Bailey informed them of the general situation. The
3rd Battalion Grenadier Guards and 1st Battalion Scots Guards were
holding the general line of Hamerville trench and also Hamel trench,
while the 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards was established on the high
ground about Judas Farm. The situation on the right, however, was not
clear, and no troops of the Second Division had been seen east of
Ervillers. The 1st Battalion was therefore to move forward as soon as
possible, gain touch with the Second Division about Ervillers, and in
conjunction with it, capture Mory Switch.</p>

<p>At 4.10 <span class="smcap">p.m</span>. the Battalion advanced in approach march
formation with the King's Company under Captain Cary on the right,
and No. 2 Company under Lieutenant H. B. Vernon on the left, with No.
3 Company under Captain Chambers in support and No. 4 Company under
Lieutenant Byng in reserve. The frontage occupied by the Battalion
was 1000 yards, with strong patrols preceding the two leading
companies at a distance of 300 yards. On reaching the line of the
Ervillers&mdash;Hamelincourt road, the leading companies came under a light
field-gun barrage and long-range machine-gun fire, which forced them
to deploy, and the support company conformed as soon as it arrived at
the same place. Captain Chambers then moved his company to a position
écheloned in rear of the King's Company, so as to be in a position
to protect the right flank. When the leading companies reached the
neighbourhood of Jewel trench, the Germans offered a certain amount
of resistance, which caused a momentary check, but the threat of an
outflanking movement by No. 3 Company broke down their defence, and
they fled, pursued by Lewis-gun and rifle fire, leaving fifty men who
were taken prisoners.</p>

<p>No. 4 Company was moved to a position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span> on the high ground on the right
to cover that flank, and was given orders to be prepared to move across
the front of Ervillers, if a hostile counter-attack developed in that
direction. The other three companies swept on to the next objective,
which was carried without a further check. The three leading companies
then proceeded forward to capture the final objective, and the defence
of the enemy broke down, as soon as he saw that the victorious advance
of the Battalion could not be stopped. By 5.45 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> the
position was completely in the hands of the Battalion, many prisoners
being taken, numbers of whom rushed forward with their hands up as
soon as the leading companies appeared over the ridge. After the
final objective had been secured, No. 4 Company returned to its
proper position in reserve, its place on the right being taken by a
sub-section of machine-guns. At dusk the Battalion was distributed as
follows: No. 3 Company in Mory Switch trench as far as Hally Avenue
(exclusive), No. 2 Company conformed from Hally Avenue (inclusive) to
Judas trench, while the King's Company formed a refused right flank in
shell-slits about Iscariot Work, and No. 4 Company was in reserve in
Jewel trench.</p>

<p>Considering the extent of ground that had been covered and the rapidity
with which the objective had been secured, the casualties were not
heavy: Lieutenant Rocke, who had been with the leading platoon of the
King's Company, was killed, and Captain Cary in the King's Company
and Lieutenant Conant of No. 2 Com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>pany were wounded. The casualties
amongst other ranks amounted to about forty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aug. 24.</div>

<p>At 4 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> Major Bailey received orders to continue the attack,
and summoned a conference of Company Commanders. He explained to them
that the Battalion was to advance at 7 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> on a front of 1000
yards and écheloned in depth. No. 4 Company was to lead the attack on a
front of 500 yards, with the left flank on Hally Avenue; No. 3 Company
écheloned at a distance of 250 yards on their right, No. 2 Company in
support, covering the centre at a distance of 250 yards behind the left
of No. 3 Company, and the King's Company in reserve.</p>

<p>The three leading companies were formed up by daylight in Mory Switch
trench, but the King's Company remained in its position near Iscariot
Work. The wire in front of Mory was too thick to cut before daylight,
and the men were told to work their way through the gaps as best they
could. As soon as the attack started, some thirty prisoners were taken;
they were in positions outside the wire, and surrendered without firing
a shot. A shrapnel barrage had been put down by our artillery, but it
was placed too far in advance to be of any real assistance, and as the
attack developed the Germans opened an intense machine-gun fire from
Mory Copse and Hally Copse. It soon became evident that, until some
advance was made on the right, there was no possibility of the attack
succeeding, and even if it did succeed there seemed little prospect
of the 1st Battalion retaining the position it had gained, unless the
Second Division could keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span> pace with them. Nothing could be done but
to wait until the situation on the right developed, and the difficulty
of the position was increased by the fact that all communication with
the leading companies was cut off for the remainder of the day. During
the morning Germans could be seen dribbling forward small parties to
Mory Copse, and the sniping and machine-gun fire from this direction
became more intense. At 10.45 the Second Division made an attempt
to come up on the right, but was immediately checked and suffered
considerably.</p>

<p>The casualties in the 1st Battalion were naturally heavy. Second
Lieutenant G. E. Barber was killed, and Lieutenant L. G. Byng, M.C.,
was so severely wounded that he died that evening. Major Bailey,
Captain Chambers, Lieutenant Vernon, Second Lieutenant Warner, and
Second Lieutenant Webber were wounded, and amongst the other ranks
there were 150 casualties.</p>

<p>Lord Gort, who had been temporarily commanding the 1st Guards Brigade,
returned to the Battalion that evening, and Captain Wolrige-Gordon,
M.C., came up to take over command of No. 4 Company, while Lieutenant
Hawkesworth left Battalion Headquarters to command No. 3 Company. On
learning that the Brigade was to continue the attack on the following
day with the assistance of eight tanks, Lord Gort went round the
line at dusk, and decided that, as the King's and No. 3 Companies
had suffered fewest casualties, they should undertake the attack. He
therefore gave orders for these two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span> companies to withdraw for the
night, and get as much rest as they could in Mory Switch, while No.
2 and 4 Companies should supply the outposts; and he impressed on
the officers commanding these companies, that in view of the attack
the next day the men should be spared as much as possible, and that
defensive measures for the night should be undertaken mainly by patrols.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aug. 25.</div>

<p>After consultation with the officers commanding the 2nd Battalion
Scots Guards, the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards, and the tanks, Lord
Gort returned to his Battalion Headquarters, and summoned the Company
Commanders&mdash;Second Lieutenant Cruttenden, King's Company; Lieutenant
A. A. Morris, No. 2 Company; Lieutenant Hawkesworth, No. 3 Company;
and Captain Wolrige-Gordon, No. 4 Company. The details of the attack
were explained, and orders were issued. The total fighting strength of
the Battalion was only 212 with 7 officers, including the Battalion
Headquarters Staff.</p>

<p>In order to increase the number of officers, Captain Malcolm was sent
up to join the King's Company. He received this order only at 10
<span class="smcap">P.M.</span> the night before, and the distance he had to go made it
most improbable that he could reach the Battalion before the attack
started. But his determination to lead the King's Company into action
helped him to overcome all difficulties. By dint of riding and walking
all night over appalling country, without any guide, he managed to find
the Battalion in time.</p>

<p>At 4.30 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> the attack started. A very thick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span> mist covered
the ground, which made it difficult for the tanks to find their way.
Lieutenant Hawkesworth started off with No. 3 Company supported by one
tank, but when he reached the neighbourhood of Bank's Trench the tank
broke down, and when the fog lifted he found he had only forty men
quite unsupported. Unfortunately, at this moment he was badly wounded,
and therefore ordered his men, who were without an officer, to fall
back on to Mory Switch.</p>

<p>The King's and No. 4 Companies moved up Mory Switch supported by one
tank, while another worked on the southern flank. The fog was still
thick, and as the first tank advanced it was suddenly engaged at very
close range by a stray machine-gun post. Armour-piercing bullets
were used, and the engine and water jacket were penetrated. It was
therefore necessary to find the other tank, which could be heard
working in the fog, and after an unsuccessful attempt to get it going
in the right direction, it eventually succeeded in moving forward at
8.30 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, supported by the King's Company and a platoon of
No. 4 Company. But soon afterwards the fog lifted, and the tank was
immediately put out of action. Germans in bodies of fifty and one
hundred could be seen standing about in Bank's Trench, but as the
King's Company and a platoon of No. 3 Company were close by, Lord Gort
did not give the order to engage these hostile parties with machine-gun
fire, until he could ascertain if they were prisoners surrendering or
not. After a lapse of five minutes fire was opened on them, and they
disappeared into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span> their trenches. Meanwhile the enemy opened a very
heavy and concentrated machine-gun fire on Mory Switch, and engaged the
disabled tank with a field-gun. Lord Gort having been called back to
Battalion Headquarters to speak to the Brigadier on the telephone with
reference to the attack of the Sixty-second Division, which was timed
to begin at 9 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, ordered Captain Wolrige-Gordon to hold
on to Mory Switch and Camouflage Copse. But the enfilade machine-gun
fire made this impossible, more especially as the right flank was quite
unsupported, and the three companies had to withdraw from Mory Switch
to the north-west of Mory.</p>

<p>At 4 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> after a severe bombardment the Germans developed
a counter-attack, which was met by the Sixty-second Division, and
driven back. Battalions of this division returned to the attack, and
regained some ground, while the 1st Battalion reoccupied Mory Switch.
Lord Gort told the captain of the leading company of the battalion
from the Sixty-second Division that he was prepared to push on to the
sunken road, if his company would co-operate, but the Company Commander
replied that the right flank of his battalion was entirely unsupported,
and that therefore any further advance was out of the question. The
Sixty-second Division was subsequently withdrawn to the line from which
they started, but the 1st Battalion was able to maintain its position
and to clear Hally Copse of the enemy. That night it withdrew to Boiry
St. Martin, and was relieved by the 2nd Battalion Grenadier Guards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Malcolm and Second Lieutenant Cruttenden were reported
missing, and Lieutenant Hawkesworth was wounded. The total number of
casualties during the three days' fighting was 13 officers and 258
other ranks, out of 18 officers and 489 other ranks who were engaged
in the operations. 250 prisoners, 1 field-gun, and 20 machine-guns, in
addition to several trench mortars, were captured by the Battalion.</p>

<p>In a letter which Brigadier-General G. B. S. Follett, commanding
the 3rd Guards Brigade, wrote to Sir Henry Streatfeild, the
Lieutenant-Colonel commanding the Regiment, he said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>As you have probably heard by now, we attacked on the 23rd,
24th, and 25th August&mdash;that is, this Brigade. The 1st
Battalion Grenadiers gave the finest exhibition that has ever
been made in this war. At 3 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> on the 23rd they
were sent up to protect the right flank of the 2nd Brigade and
take the heights south of St. Leger. There was just time to
issue verbal orders and to collect the Company Commanders for
a conference. Starting about 3.45 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> they had taken
all objectives before 6 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>&mdash;that is, advancing
5000 yards from their starting point! Having been very highly
trained by Gort during the past month or two, they proceeded
to put their training into practice, with the result that it
was a wonderful success. Commanded by Bailey (Gort was with
the 1st Guards Brigade), they were magnificently man&#339;uvred
by their company and platoon commanders, moving in great depth
on a very wide extension. They captured 197 prisoners, 15
machine-guns and several trench mortars, and killed a lot.
Their casualties were 2 officers and 50 O.R. I say again, the
finest attack in open warfare that has ever been made. During
the night 23-24 they even did a relief, and we were up against
the junction of two fresh divisions in great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span> strength, with
the result that no great advance was made and many losses.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Aug. 26-31.</div>

<p>After remaining for twenty-four hours at Boiry St. Martin, the
Battalion marched to Berles-au-Bois, where it occupied shelters in a
bank. Lieutenant E. B. Shelley and twenty-five men joined, in addition
to a large draft from the 4th Battalion under Captain Simpson, and the
following days were spent in reorganising the companies.</p>

<p>The 2nd Battalion, which had been training during the first few days
in July at Saulty, proceeded by train on the 5th to Ransart, where
tea was provided for the men by the Thirty-second Division. Guides
from the Royal Scots led the Battalion to the position which it was to
take up as reserve battalion of the brigade 500 yards east of Ransart.
The Guards Division was occupying a sector of the line with its right
joining the Second Division between Ayette and Moyenneville, and its
left joining the Canadian Corps on the outskirts of Boisieux St. Marc.
While in reserve, companies carried out training round the outskirts of
Ransart, and scouting and patrolling by day were practised. In order
to accustom the men to night-work they wore darkened glasses, which
produced much the same effect as night. On the 11th the Battalion moved
up into support, and relieved the 1st Battalion Irish Guards near the
outskirts of Hendecourt. A place was found for a cricket-ground in a
sheltered valley, and two matches were played with composition balls
and bats made by the pioneers. From the 17th to the 23rd the Battalion
went up into the front line, which had been formerly held by isolated
posts, but which was now a continuous trench. The weather was fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span> and
the casualties were not heavy, although there was usually a certain
amount of shelling in the early morning. From the 24th to the 28th the
Battalion returned to the reserve trenches at Ransart, when Lieutenant
T. A. Combe, Lieutenant M. H. Ponsonby, Second Lieutenant A. P. J. M.
P. de Lisle, and Second Lieutenant D. L. King joined the Battalion.
During the days in reserve an increasing stream of American officers
were attached to the 1st Guards Brigade for instruction, and the
following amusing messages show the excellent relations that existed
between the officers of the two armies:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="left2">From:&mdash;Guards Division Q.</p>

<p class="left2">To:&mdash;Transport Officer, 1st Guards Brigade.</p>

<p>Draw 6 bottles of Whisky from Divisional Soldiers Club and
deliver to Brigade H.Q. for American Officers attached.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p class="left2">From G.O.C. 1st Guards Brigade.</p>

<p class="left2">To:&mdash;Guards Division Q.</p>

<p>On behalf of all officers of the American Army attached to
the Brigade under my command, I wish to express my deepest
thanks for the courteous present of whisky foreshadowed in
your message. I am requested to add that these officers accept
this gift as a proof of the solidarity of the union existing
between the American and British nations, which will endure
until the whisky runs out.</p>

<p class="smcap r1">C. R. C. de Crespigny,</p>

<p class="r2">Brigadier-General.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Aug.</div>

<p>While the Battalion was in support at Hendecourt, Captain A. H. Penn,
M.C., resigned the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span> adjutancy, much to the regret of all ranks, and
was succeeded by Captain R. G. Briscoe, M.C. On August 4 the Battalion
went up into the front line in front of Boiry St. Martin, and on August
5 six platoons of Americans who were to be initiated in the mysteries
of trench warfare were attached for four days. The enemy was, however,
not very active, and there was but little shelling. From the 10th to
the 16th the Battalion remained in reserve at Ransart, where Lieutenant
G. F. Lawrence took on the duties of Intelligence Officer from Second
Lieutenant S. C. K. George, who was invalided home with dysentery. On
the 18th the Battalion relieved the 320th American Regiment in the
front line, where again the enemy was fairly quiet. Two advanced posts
were established some 500 yards from the line, and the nights were
spent in active patrolling to prevent the enemy occupying the dead
ground in front of Moyenneville, which was to become the forming-up
area for the attack on the 21st.</p>

<p>After three days spent in the reserve, the Battalion moved up into very
inadequate trench accommodation in Boiry St. Martin. These trenches
were now the reserve line, and out of range of enemy artillery owing to
the advance on the 21st.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aug. 25.</div>

<p>On the afternoon of the 25th the Battalion marched off to relieve a
battalion in the 3rd Guards Brigade. A three hours' uncomfortable
halt was made in a field at Hamelincourt, and as the ground had been
well covered with gas, the companies had to move about to escape the
drifting fumes. Respirators had to be worn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span> which rendered the eating
of the evening meal no easy matter.</p>

<p>The relief in the front line of St. Leger was carried out without a
hitch, although complicated by the fact that the Battalion was taking
over a wide and sketchy front from the remnants of the 1st Battalion
Grenadier Guards and the 1st Battalion Scots Guards. During the night
Second Lieutenant H. A. Finch and eight men went out as a patrol to
get in touch with the enemy and never returned. Second Lieutenant
Finch was found killed 1000 yards in front of the line, when the
Battalion advanced, which showed how thoroughly he had carried out his
instructions.</p>

<p>August 26 was a very quiet day, with occasional shelling around Mory
Trench. Judging by the extent to which he fired his machine-guns after
dark, the enemy seemed very apprehensive. The following officers took
part in the operations on August 26-28:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aug. 26.</div>

<p>At midnight on the 26th a conference held at Battalion Headquarters
was attended by all Company Commanders, at which Lieut.-Colonel Rasch
explained the general situation and the objectives of the advance for
the following day as far as they were known.</p>

<p>Definite orders were not received until 1.30 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> on the
morning of the 27th. The instructions the Battalion received were to
push forward at zero hour (7 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>), with the 2nd Battalion
Coldstream Guards on its left, and the Sixty-second Division on its
right, and to secure the enemy's trenches in and south of Ecoust and
Longatte. Before dawn the Battalion was to be reorganised and disposed
in battle formation. No. 3 Company under Captain J. C. Cornforth, M.C.,
extended along the whole Battalion frontage of 1500 yards, along the
road in No Man's Land, running from Mory Copse to St. Leger. No. 2
Company under Captain O. M. Smith in left support lay concealed until
zero in Hally Copse. No. 4 Company under Lieutenant Morgan was in right
support in Mory Copse, and No. 1 Company under Lieutenant M. Ponsonby
in reserve, with Battalion Headquarters in Mory Trench.</p>

<p>There were three points in these orders which caused a little
uneasiness. In the first place, a very short space of time before
dawn was allowed to re-dispose the Battalion, although fortunately
strong patrols had been sent out earlier in the night to secure the
Mory Copse&mdash;St. Leger road. In the second place, dawn being at 4.30
<span class="smcap">A.M.</span> and zero at 7 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, No. 3 Company would be in
an exposed position during daylight at some points<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span> within fifty yards
of the enemy. It was a clear night, and even in the darkness this
company got into difficulties, for while they were forming up, they
were observed by the enemy, who spent the rest of the night sweeping
the ground and putting up innumerable lights, probably thinking it was
a patrol. Fortunately there were a number of large felled tree-trunks
along the road, which enabled this Company to escape detection
from ground observation, and from the low-flying aeroplanes, which
continually patrolled No Man's Land at dawn. In the third place,
although Bank's Trench was known to be held all along the whole front,
the barrage table showed that on the left of the Battalion the barrage
would open a considerable distance behind the trench, probably owing to
the proximity of our front troops to the enemy position.</p>

<p>The reorganisation and forming up of the Battalion were successfully
carried out before dawn. Unfortunately, while No. 1 Company was moving
across the open to take up its position in reserve, a shell fell in the
centre of No. 1 Platoon, mortally wounding Lieutenant M. Ponsonby, and
causing casualties to the whole platoon, with the exception of three
other ranks. Lieutenant Jesper took command of the remaining three
platoons, and brought them to their allotted positions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aug. 27.</div>

<p>At zero hour (7 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>) the field-gun barrage came down on a
line about 300 yards in front of No. 3 Company, creeping forward at
the rate of 100 yards every two minutes. As soon as our troops moved
off from their forming-up positions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span> to close up to the barrage, the
enemy covered his front with a deadly and accurate screen of bullets,
fired from numerous carefully-sighted machine-guns, which were so well
protected that our field-gun barrage had little or no effect upon them.
In consequence we suffered heavy casualties from the very outset. On
the left the troops of the leading company were mown down as soon as
they got on to their feet, and were unable to advance. The right of the
2nd Battalion Coldstream Guards had also suffered severely, and was
unable to push forward.</p>

<p>As No. 2 Company, under Captain O. Martin Smith, debouched from Hally
Copse, it was caught by the machine-gun fire, and nearly cut to pieces
before it could extend from artillery formation. Captain O. Martin
Smith made a determined effort to reinforce the left of No. 3 Company,
and push forward the advance, but long before his Company reached the
front troops it had suffered over 50 per cent casualties. Captain O.
Martin Smith and Lieutenant de Lisle were wounded, and Lieutenant
Gwyer, who was pluckily pushing forward in spite of the storm of
bullets, was killed. Captain O. Martin Smith ordered his Company to
lie down in the open, while the N.C.O.'s collected the men who were
nearest to them, and eventually got in close support of No. 3 Company.
As, however, the enemy was entrenched on the top of the rise, 200 yards
in front, the slightest movement attracted a torrent of lead. This
made it impossible to get communication in any direction or to collect
the wounded, who had to remain in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span> the open on the fire-swept ground
until dark. Lieutenant R. M. Oliver, who had been in charge of the left
platoon of No. 3 Company, had been killed earlier, so the left half of
the Battalion was now without an officer.</p>

<p>In the centre, during the first 200 yards, the machine-gun fire,
although equally intense, was slightly less accurate; but on nearing
the St. Leger&mdash;Homme Mort road Captain Cornforth found it swept by a
practically impassable hail of machine-gun bullets, fired from three
directions&mdash;the Homme Mort on the south, Bank's Trench on the east, and
outskirts of St. Leger on the north. This last enemy position was off
the Battalion frontage, and the troops opposite it had been held up.
The only method of relieving this pressure on the left was to push on
at all costs in our centre and right.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Rasch sent up No. 1 Company to reinforce the thinned
ranks of No. 3, and to help in the capture of Homme Mort and the
rushing of Bank's Trench. While going up this Company came under heavy
fire, and Lieutenant Jesper and Lieutenant Giles were both wounded.
Captain Cornforth therefore took over command of this Company in
addition to his own.</p>

<p>With these reinforcements Lieutenant White and Second Lieutenant
Langley led their platoons forward against the machine-gun nest at
Homme Mort, but in advancing up the slope they were met with an
increasing volume of accurate fire, and both the officers were mortally
wounded before the position was reached. These platoons, however, with
an inspired dash and determination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span> took the position after a hard
fight. Twenty prisoners were captured, in spite of the fact that, in
the short rush up to the position, these platoons had been practically
decimated.</p>

<p>At the same time Captain Cornforth decided to rush Bank's Trench,
although the road was still swept by enfilade fire from the left,
and by frontal fire from the trench itself. A party of men was sent
over the road to cover the advance, but few succeeded in crossing it.
Captain Cornforth thereupon collected a small number of men, led them
across the road, and by short rushes succeeded with three other men in
gaining Bank's Trench. Here fortunately they found a large supply of
German hand-grenades, which they quickly detonated, and by this means
succeeded in clearing the trench for 500 yards northwards, knocking
out six German machine-guns and taking 40 men prisoners. Several other
men soon succeeded in joining them, and this party, which eventually
numbered one officer and 25 men, found that they were completely
isolated. No other troops could be located on their flanks, and the
ground was being swept by machine-gun fire from Bank's Copse in the
front, from the high ground on the right, and from the outskirts of St.
Leger on the left. It was impossible to advance farther, and the rest
of the day was spent in resisting the efforts of the Germans to turn
them out, and in endeavouring to gain communication on the flanks.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Morgan with No. 4 Company was more successful. At zero he
advanced along Mory Switch and the southern end of Bank's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span> Trench,
eventually establishing a position in Vraucourt Trench. The lie of the
land and the cover afforded by the trenches enabled this Company to
keep up with the barrage, and to avoid coming under the intense fire
that the remainder of the Battalion had experienced. During the advance
this Company captured a German Battalion Commander and 180 men&mdash;a
remarkably fine performance. Lieutenant Morgan led his Company forward
with such dash that they succeeded in penetrating the enemy's position
to a depth of 2000 yards. However, it was soon clear that they were
completely isolated, as they were being fired at from all directions.
When it was dark Lieutenant Morgan decided that it would be unwise to
remain in such an advanced position, since neither the Sixty-second
Division on his right nor our own troops on his left showed any signs
of coming into line with him, and he consequently withdrew his Company
until he was in touch with troops on his flanks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aug. 28.</div>

<p>During the night the enemy retired from our front, and in the morning
the remnants of the Battalion were reorganised, and continued the
advance over the original frontage for about 1700 yards to a marked-out
trench called Bank's Reserve. Here some machine-guns were encountered,
but a good and continuous line was established with connection on both
flanks.</p>

<p>This line was handed over to the 1st Battalion Gordon Highlanders
on the night of the 28th-29th, and the Battalion marched back to
the trenches east of Hamelincourt. The only officers left with the
Battalion were Lieut.-Colonel Rasch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span> Captain Cornforth, Captain
Briscoe, and Lieutenant Morgan. The total casualties were 12 officers
and 278 other ranks. Amongst the officers the casualties were as

<p>In a message, which Major-General Feilding afterwards sent to
Brigadier-General de Crespigny, he said: "All Battalions of the 1st
Guards Brigade discharged their duty splendidly. The attack delivered
by the 2nd Battalion Grenadier Guards and 2nd Battalion Coldstream
Guards on August 27 not only inflicted heavy losses on the enemy and
brought in large numbers of prisoners, but also compelled him next day
to relax his hold on the high ground south of Croisilles."</p>

<div class="sidenote">July.</div>

<p>The first week in July was spent by the 3rd Battalion at Labazeque,
and on the 7th it proceeded to Ransart, where it relieved the 10th
Battalion Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in the right sector of the
front occupied by the Guards Division.</p>

<p>Two companies were placed in the front line with one company in support
and one in reserve, and officers' patrols were sent out every night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
from dusk to dawn, but there was no movement on the part of the enemy.
On the 10th the Battalion moved back into support, and on the 15th into
Divisional Reserve, where it remained for three days. From the 19th to
the 24th the Battalion went up again into the front trenches, where
the work consisted of improving the line by laying down duckboards and
digging sumps and latrines. Fifteen officers, 30 sergeants, and 55
corporals from the American Army were attached to the Battalion, and
were distributed between the four companies and Battalion Headquarters.
Lieutenant S. G. Fairbairn, Second Lieutenant H. P. Gordon, and
Second Lieutenant S. Calvocoressi arrived during this tour of duty
in the trenches, and on the 25th the Battalion retired into support,
where more officers and men of the American Army were attached for
instruction. On the 30th the Battalion moved back into Divisional
Reserve.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aug.</div>

<p>After four days in reserve the Battalion went up into the front line
near Adinfer, where it remained for a week carrying out inter-company
relief. In this part of the line patrols were sent out every night,
and a company from the 320th Regiment of the United States Army,
which accompanied the Battalion, supplied a certain number of men for
this purpose. On the 6th Second Lieutenant R. P. Papillon when out
on patrol duty, encountered a German patrol in Observation Trench,
and after severely wounding one of the enemy, succeeded in bringing
back an identification mark. The Higher Command, however, required
further information, and accord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>ingly a special patrol was sent out on
the night of the 10th. Captain Churchill, whose great experience in
all kinds of incursions into the enemy's line rendered him eminently
fitted for the task, was sent from the Brigade Headquarters, to take
charge of the party, which consisted of Second Lieutenant de Reuter
and seven men. A covering-party composed of thirteen men, under the
command of Sergeant Birtles, accompanied the raiders. Hardly had the
patrol started, when a shell fell among them, wounding one man, who
had to be carried back to the trenches. Following the German outpost
line, which consisted of small adjacent rifle-pits, but which showed
no sign of frequent occupation, the patrol came on the German wire.
This formidable obstacle consisted of barbed wire in concertina
shape, staked to the ground, with strands running through it. After
a careful search a gap was found, and through this the patrol went.
After following the track for about forty yards a German sentry was
seen. The patrol stood still, and the sentry walked away unconscious of
its presence. Soon afterwards some more of the enemy were seen moving
round to the left of the track. They were evidently suspicious, as
they only whispered. Three of them came crawling slowly towards the
patrol. In dead silence the patrol waited, but the Germans turned back,
and apparently reported all clear, for thirty to forty more Germans
appeared, and stood up close together. They came to within thirty
yards of the patrol, when Lieutenant de Reuter gave the order "rapid
fire." Several of them were seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span> to fall. It was now merely a question
whether the Germans would attempt to capture the patrol or not, but
they contented themselves with firing and throwing a few bombs,
while Véry lights were sent up. Captain Churchill therefore retired
unmolested through the wire, having only had one man wounded.</p>

<p>On the 10th Second Lieutenant de Geijer and twenty other ranks raided a
German post under an artillery barrage. At 3.15 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> a Stokes
mortar barrage supplemented the artillery bombardment, and the raiding
party in two groups, under Second Lieutenant de Geijer and Sergeant
Butler respectively, rushed the enemy's post. The Germans had, however,
abandoned the post just before the raid took place, and the last
two were seen to run from it, as the raiders started. Much valuable
information was gained, as the Germans left everything behind, but,
with the exception of Lieutenant de Geijer who was slightly wounded,
there were no casualties.</p>

<p>On the 11th the Battalion was relieved by the 1st Battalion Coldstream,
and went into support, moving on four days later to billets in Saulty,
where it remained until the 20th.</p>

<p>On the 20th the Battalion "debussed" between Blaireville and
Heudecourt, and took up its assembly positions east and south-east of
Boiry.</p>

<p>The orders General Sergison-Brooke received were to attack Moyenneville
in conjunction with the Second and Third Divisions on the right. In
the operation orders which he issued the capture of the first two
objectives was to be carried out by the 1st Battalion Scots Guards on
the right,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span> and by the 1st Battalion Coldstream on the left. The 3rd
Battalion Grenadiers was then to pass through, and secure the third
objective. Eight tanks would co-operate in front of each Battalion.</p>

<p>The following officers of the 3rd Battalion took part in these
operations:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aug. 21.</div>

<p>There was a thick mist in the morning, so thick that it was impossible
to see more than a few yards ahead. On the one hand this favoured the
attackers; on the other there was always the risk of the Battalion
losing its way and never reaching the enemy's lines. In spite of
everything, however, the leading Battalions eventually succeeded in
securing the first two objectives.</p>

<p>The 3rd Battalion had breakfasted, water-bottles had been refilled,
and the companies were beginning to get ready for the advance, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
this blanket of fog came down. At zero hour, 4.53 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, the
barrage opened up and the attack began. Captain Smith, who commanded
C Company 15th Battalion Tank Corps (Mark V. Star Tanks), arrived at
Battalion Headquarters, and reported that his tanks had been delayed
by gas in Coseul Valley, so that they would not be able to advance
with the Battalion as arranged, but that they would endeavour to
overtake it on the second objective. The Battalion started off with
No. 3 Company under Captain Tufnell on the right, No. 4 under Captain
Hirst on the left, No. 2 under Lieutenant Adair in support, and No. 1
under Captain Fryer in reserve. The fog was as thick as ever, and the
smoke shells in the barrage increased its density. Keeping direction by
compass was tedious and difficult, since it necessitated the removal
of the steel helmet and box respirator, and even then it was far from
accurate. To add to the difficulties, there were several pockets of
German machine-gunners, which had been missed by the 1st Battalion
Scots Guards in their advance, and which suddenly loomed out in the
mist often in rear of the Battalion as it advanced. No. 12 Platoon
captured two machine-gun posts in the first objective, and the markers
under Lieutenant de Geijer, the Intelligence Officer, found German
machine-gunners still holding out to the west of the second objective,
in the area where the Battalion should have formed up. The 1st
Battalion Scots Guards had captured the right and left of the second
objective, but owing to the fog the centre was still in the hands of
the Germans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>The 1st Battalion Scots Guards, on finding out what had happened, soon
cleared out these Germans with the aid of No. 1 Company (the Reserve
Company).</p>

<p>By 6 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> the Battalion Headquarters had reached its
destination, namely, the two trees between the first and second
objectives, but was unable to get in touch with any of the companies.
Tanks were moving about in the fog, and the Lewis guns were
engaging the German machine-guns at close quarters, and were firing
indiscriminately into the fog. To give an example of how confusing the
situation was, the Battalion Headquarters was charged from the front
by two platoons of the Scots Guards, who mistook it in the fog for a
German machine-gun post.</p>

<p>By 7.30 No. 2 Company, under Lieutenant Adair, had gone through
the junction of the 1st Battalion Scots Guards and 1st Battalion
Coldstream, and was advancing on its objective, which was the valley
between the railway and Moyenneville. A little later Captain Tufnell
and Captain Hirst reported that Nos. 9 and 12 Platoons of No. 3 Company
and all No. 4 Company were near Moyblain Trench, having completely lost
their way. No. 11 Platoon had also lost its bearings, and after moving
round in a semicircle, was discovered heading towards the rear instead
of towards the front.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lieutenant Duff Cooper, with No. 10 Platoon, having
entirely lost touch with the remainder of the company, had wandered
too far to the south, and after pushing on in what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span> he thought was the
right direction for three hours, found himself in the outskirts of
Courcelles. There he met a platoon of the 7th Battalion K.S.L.I., which
had also lost its way, and, knowing that the Halte on the railway was
the eventual objective, he determined to make for it. Together these
two platoons started off, and as they were clearing the dug-outs on the
road, they fell in with a tank which suddenly appeared out of the fog.
With its assistance they attacked and captured the railway on each side
of the Halte, where a German aid-post was placed. There is no doubt
that these two isolated platoons were the only units that succeeded in
reaching the third objective for some hours, on the whole front of the
two Northern Divisions.</p>

<p>When Lieut.-Colonel Thorne received a message from Lieutenant Duff
Cooper, saying that the Halte had been taken, he sent up No. 1 Company
under Captain Fryer to the assistance of this isolated platoon, and in
order to save time directed No. 2 Company to advance on the objective
originally assigned to No. 4. Lieutenant Forbes with two machine-guns
was sent up to co-operate with No. 1 Company, and Lieutenant Hulme with
two more to assist No. 2 Company. No barrage could be arranged for this
attack, and it was impossible to obtain any assistance from the tanks,
which were now returning to their rallying positions, since they were
all suffering from engine trouble or the lack of petrol.</p>

<p>At 10 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> the fog began to lift, but Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span> Fryer had by
this time brought up Nos. 1 and 2 Platoons to the assistance of No. 10
Platoon. Captain Fryer and Lieutenant Duff Cooper made a most valuable
reconnaissance of the railway north of the Halte under heavy fire,
and on returning decided at once to attack the German posts they had
discovered. No. 10 Platoon started off, and supported by Nos. 1 and 2
Platoons succeeded in capturing the whole of the objectives allotted
to No. 3 Company. This attack was carried out with great dash, but
Lieutenant Delacombe and Second Lieutenant Clough-Taylor were wounded.</p>

<p>Nos. 7 and 8 Platoons of No. 2 Company had in the meantime commenced
their advance on the railway cutting, but soon found that they were
exposed to heavy enfilade fire from the railway north of the Halte.
They made but little headway at first, but, when the attack of No. 10
Platoon lifted the enemy's fire off them, they pushed forward, and
rushed the railway and hollow ground to the east of it, capturing 5
machine-guns and 60 prisoners, and gaining touch with the 1st Battalion
Coldstream Guards on the left and No. 1 Company on the right.</p>

<p>No. 3 Company now moved up into support of No. 1, and four machine-guns
were placed in Magazine Trench as barrage guns. No. 6 Platoon made a
farther advance, and seized the hollow east of the railway and west of
Hameau North, where 10 machine-guns and 60 prisoners were captured.
Nos. 3 and 8 Platoons advanced to the east of the railway, and
completed the capture of the whole objective allotted to the Battalion.
Although twelve hours behind the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span> scheduled time, Lieut.-Colonel Thorne
was able to report that the task of the Battalion had been successfully
carried out.</p>

<p>The leading of No. 10 Platoon and Nos. 1 and 2 Companies was
particularly fine, and the response made by the men was beyond all
praise. The fact that in spite of the fog each platoon managed to
get to its own place was entirely due to the persistence with which
Platoon Commanders advanced whenever opportunity offered, and to the
determination on the part of the men to reach the enemy. After the fog
lifted the attack was carried out steadily and relentlessly across
ground swept by shell-fire and machine-guns, and succeeded in spite of
the lack of an artillery barrage or tanks.</p>

<p>After dark, ammunition, water and rations were sent up by pack animals,
and all the platoons rejoined their companies. Reconnoitring patrols
under Lieutenant Clifton Brown and Lieutenant West were sent out to
locate the new German line, and discovered that the enemy was holding
the line of the sunken road about half a mile east of the railway. The
Germans were apparently in some strength, and very much on the look-out.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aug. 22.</div>

<p>The next morning a heavy hostile barrage came down on the whole
position occupied by the Battalion, and the outposts could see the
enemy advancing in three waves. The S.O.S. signal at once went up.
Immediately our artillery put down a magnificent and accurate barrage,
and the companies in front opened a concentrated fire with Lewis guns
and rifles on the advancing <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>enemy. The German counter-attack stood
no chance at all, and completely crumbled away; only in one place did
the Germans succeed in gaining a footing, and that was on the right,
where they captured a trench. When the attack utterly failed, this
party of Germans had to withdraw with heavy loss.</p>

<p>The following German orders that were subsequently taken from a
prisoner give the details of this counter-attack. It will be seen that
they advanced in some strength, and it is all the more remarkable that
this carefully planned attack should have been repulsed by only two
companies of the 3rd Battalion.</p>

<p class="center p-left sm">SEPTEMBER</p>

<p class="center p-left"><i>Diary of the War</i></p>


<div class="sidenote">Sept. 1918.</div>

<p>The German retreat still continued, and the Allies gained ground all
along the line. The salient at St. Mihiel was carried by the American
Army, and the Hindenburg line was captured by the British. A combined
attack of the British and Belgian troops under the command of King
Albert succeeded beyond all expectation, and the British Fleet was
able to join in and bombard the coast. An Austrian offer to enter into
Peace negotiations was published, and at the same time the Germans made
overtures to the Belgians, but the Allied conference at Versailles
refused even to consider either of these proposals.</p>

<p>In Macedonia the Allied Forces inflicted a defeat on the Bulgarians,
who retreated on a front of nearly 100 miles, and on September 25 the
Bulgarian Government applied for an unconditional armistice.</p>

<p>In Palestine General Allenby commenced a series of attacks on the Turks
between Rafat and the sea, and on the 30th Damascus was taken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>


<h3 class="smcap">Divisional Account</h3>

<p>During September Marshal Foch followed up his successes all along the
line, and the Germans were forced to abandon position after position.
Ludendorff, however, always imagined that the Siegfried line was
impregnable, and that if the German Army succeeded in getting back
there intact, there was no reason why this position should not be held
during the winter.</p>

<p>To the British Army was assigned the difficult task of piercing this
impregnable line and rendering it untenable, but many doubts were
expressed as to whether this was feasible. Sir Douglas Haig, however,
was convinced that it could be done, and directed the First and Third
Armies to open the attack in the direction of Cambrai, in the hopes
that after they had advanced it would be possible for the Fourth Army
to pierce the strongest part of the line farther south.</p>

<p>After the operations at the end of August the Guards Division had only
five days' rest before it was again put into the line. On September
2 the Canadian Corps had broken the Drocourt&mdash;Queant Switch, whilst
on the Sixth Corps front the Third Division had, after very heavy
fighting, made ground in the neighbourhood of Noreuil and Lagnicourt.
The Guards Division moved up from the Ransart area, and was ordered to
continue the attack the following day. The position of the advanced
troops of the Third Division was so uncertain that it was decided to
form up for the attack, along the railway line just east of Noreuil,
some distance in rear of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span> line which the Third Division claimed to
have reached, the troops of this Division being then withdrawn. This
necessitated the sacrifice of a certain amount of ground won by the
Third Division at a heavy cost, but it ensured a straight jumping-off
line, and enormously simplified the task of the artillery. (This
procedure was repeated on October 9, and on each occasion was fully
justified by results.)</p>

<p>After a long and tiring march from their rest areas, Sergison-Brooke's
and Follett's Brigades formed up on the right and left respectively,
with De Crespigny's Brigade in reserve south of St. Leger. The attack
started under a very good barrage at 5.20 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> Reports soon
showed that the enemy had withdrawn during the night, and the advance
continued without opposition until the old British front line, just
short of the Hindenburg line, was reached. By this time the troops were
utterly exhausted, having covered since noon the previous day some
twenty miles, in full fighting kit and over hilly country.</p>

<p>During the course of the advance a number of prisoners and guns were
captured, but the most noticeable feature on the ground which was
recovered was the enormous number of the enemy's dead horses which
littered and often blocked the roads: eloquent testimony of the work of
our aeroplanes and long-range guns, but entailing heavy and unpleasant
fatigue work for our tired troops.</p>

<p>On September 4 Follett's Brigade was ordered to push forward, and form
an advance-guard for the rest of the Division, but it found that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Germans were holding the Hindenburg line in some force. This prevented
any ground being gained, and the line soon stabilised along the Army
front.</p>

<p>The principal features of the operations that took place between
September 5 and 26 were:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Some fine trench fighting, by which the 1st Battalion Grenadier
Guards, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel Lord Gort, reached the line
of the Canal du Nord.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The heavy and continuous fighting for the village of M&#339;uvres
farther north, during which it changed hands several times before being
finally captured and held by the Fifty-second Division.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The heavy gas-shelling, with which the Germans searched all
possible assembly positions every night in evident fear of an attack,
and which, but for the improved gas discipline, would have caused heavy
casualties.</p>

<p>During this period the troops had the satisfaction of seeing two huge
German bombing 'planes brought down in flames, on successive nights by
our night-flying scouts, working in conjunction with the reorganised
searchlight system.</p>

<p>On September 11 Major-General Feilding left to take command of the
London District on the retirement of Lieut.-General Sir Francis Lloyd,
who had held that command with conspicuous success during the war. For
four years Sir Francis Lloyd had occupied one of the most responsible
and difficult positions in the Army, and had dealt, especially in
the initial stages of the war, with innumerable problems requiring
consummate skill, judgment, and tact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>There were several generals who were eligible to succeed Major-General
Feilding in command of the Guards Division; all of them had fought
consistently for four years, and had been proved and tempered in
the furnace of war. The choice of the Commander-in-Chief fell upon
Major-General T. G. Matheson, C.B., an officer of exceptional ability,
who was reputed to be one of the best Divisional Commanders in the
British Army.</p>

<p>On September 25 the orders for the forthcoming attacks were issued.
The Guards Division was to attack and capture the ridge running east
from Flesquières to Premy Chapel. On the right the Third Division would
attack and capture the village of Flesquières, and on the left the
Fifty-second Division would capture the Hindenburg line west of the
Canal du Nord, after which the Sixty-third Division would pass through,
and swinging right-handed would take the Hindenburg support line and
the villages of Graincourt and Anneux. In the event of this operation
being completely successful, further objectives were given, including
Marcoing for the Third Division, Nine Wood and the outskirts of
Noyelles for the Guards Division, Cantaing and Fontaine-Notre-Dame for
the Fifty-seventh Division, which was to pass through the Sixty-third
Division. The Sixty-second and Second Divisions were to be prepared
to pass through the Third and Guards Divisions respectively, and
capture Rumilly and the high ground east of the Canal de l'Escaut. In
the Guards Division Sergison-Brooke's Brigade was to take the first
objective (the Hindenburg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span> support line) and form a defensive flank to
the left during the next advance, until Graincourt had been secured by
the Fifty-second and Sixty-third Divisions.</p>

<p>De Crespigny's Brigade would then pass through and capture the
trench-system north-west, north, and north-east of Flesquières, moving
on afterwards to the spur running from Flesquières to Cantaing with a
view to capturing the batteries in that area and turning the Graincourt
line. This advance was to synchronise with the attack by Follett's
Brigade, but was not to be pressed against strong resistance.</p>

<p>Follett's Brigade was to pass through De Crespigny's Brigade, and to
capture the third objective, including the high ground round Premy
Chapel. Detailed orders for a farther advance were given in the event
of no great resistance being encountered.</p>

<p>The attack would be supported by six brigades R.H.A., heavy artillery,
and three machine-gun companies.</p>

<p>The assembly was rendered unusually difficult by reason of the
exceptionally large number of troops that had to be accommodated, by
the necessity of avoiding gas areas, and by the extreme darkness of the
night. The 1st Battalion Scots Guards also suffered from a barrage,
which the enemy put down on their assembly trench just before zero.
The attack started at 5.20 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, and at once met with a
check on the left, where the 1st Battalion Coldstream was held up by
a machine-gun hidden under a fallen bridge. By the time this obstacle
had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span> overcome the barrage was lost, and this Battalion suffered
heavy casualties before reaching its objective, particularly near
Mammoth cross-roads, but the remainder of the Brigade reached the first
objective with very slight loss.</p>

<p>The advance to the second objective was a very difficult operation. It
was known that the Sixty-third Division could not reach Graincourt from
the north for another two hours, and General de Crespigny had therefore
to hold back his left, and push forward along Shingler Trench with his
right. In the meantime Graincourt and the trenches south of it were
kept under heavy artillery and machine-gun fire, in order to prevent,
as far as possible, the Germans enfilading the troops advancing farther
south. Flesquières was captured in conjunction with the Third Division,
but the beetroot factory to the east of it held out, so that it was
impossible for Follett's Brigade to get through in time to follow their
barrage.</p>

<p>The Fifty-second and Sixty-third Divisions on the left had been held
up, which prevented De Crespigny's Brigade from advancing, and the left
flank of the Guards Division was therefore very much extended, and
exposed to cross fire from the left. General Follett, who had come up
with General de Crespigny to see how the battle developed, before his
Brigade came into action, was killed by this cross fire. His death was
mourned by the whole Division, for there was no braver man in the Army,
and indeed it was a serious loss to his Brigade just as it was going
into action. Major-General Matheson sent orders that Lieut.-Colonel
Lord Gort was to take com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>mand of the Brigade, but that pending his
arrival General de Crespigny was to command both Brigades.</p>

<p>At this stage the battle might easily have died down, as the time-table
was out of gear; the attack on the left had apparently failed, and
the Germans in Graincourt village and Graincourt line were giving a
great deal of trouble with their cross fire. Fortunately, however,
a Commander of great enterprise and determination in Lord Gort was
in the line, and before long the 1st Battalion Grenadiers, supported
by the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards, had pushed out along the ridge
east of Flesquières, and established itself only just short of Premy
Chapel, while the 2nd Battalion Scots Guards, together with units of De
Crespigny's Brigade, formed a defensive flank along Shingler and Silver
Trenches.</p>

<p>Not long after, the Sixty-third Division, having organised a new
attack, pushed down the Hindenburg support line, and the Germans began
to pour out of Graincourt; as they streamed away, horse, foot, and gun,
towards Cantaing, they were caught in flank by rifle, machine-gun, and
artillery fire from the Guards Division, and suffered heavily. The 2nd
Battalion Grenadiers at once pushed forward and captured Orival Wood,
taking some guns, and driving the remaining batteries away.</p>

<p>The Second Division was ordered to pass through and pursue the
retreating enemy, but dusk fell before it reached the front line, and
all it could do was to take over the line occupied by the advanced
troops of the Guards Division,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span> which was withdrawn during the night to
the area east and west of the Canal du Nord.</p>

<p>On September 27 the casualties in the Guards Division were 40 officers
and 1200 other ranks. The total number of prisoners taken by the
Division was 25 officers and 703 other ranks, in addition to 10
field-guns.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">The 1st Battalion</h3>

<div class="sidenote">1st Batt.</div>

<p>On September 2 the Battalion proceeded to the area about Homme Mort,
and halted for dinner near Moyenneville. In the afternoon the whole
Brigade concentrated in Maida Vale, and Lord Gort rode forward with the
Company Commanders towards Longatte, in view of an attack the following
day. The orders for the attack were issued that night, and early the
next morning the Battalion proceeded to Noreuil, where they went into
old German dug-outs. The Germans had retired to the Hindenburg line,
and a general advance on Bourlon and M&#339;uvres was ordered (on the
whole Corps front). The 1st Battalion marched to a position west of
Lagnicourt, where they remained for the night. A farther advance was
made the next day, and on the 5th it reached Louverval Wood, where a
week was spent training and practising open warfare.</p>

<p>On the 11th the Battalion moved up into the front line, but the relief
was only effected by the infiltration of the companies through troops
of the 50th Infantry Brigade. This Brigade, having made an attack
that evening, had failed to secure its objective, and the relief was
conse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>quently not an easy one. Lord Gort and Captain Simpson spent the
night reconnoitring the trenches in the outer zone of the Hindenburg
line, in constant danger of being caught by the Germans, and the
information they gained enabled the Battalion to establish itself by
dawn the next morning in the objective, which the 5th Infantry Brigade
had intended to secure the night before. At dawn a bombing attack
was made up Brown Trench, and the line of Alban Avenue was secured.
A barrage, supporting the attack on Havrincourt, was put down on the
whole front, and soon brought retaliation from the enemy. Near the
sunken trench in Alban Avenue a shell burst, killing Lieutenant E. B.
Shelley, and wounding Second Lieutenant Payne severely and Captain
Simpson slightly. In addition to the shelling, the enemy's machine-guns
were very active, enfilading Alban Avenue. In the afternoon the 225th
German Infantry Regiment carried out a bombing attack on Beatty and
Babs posts, but was repulsed with several killed and wounded, leaving
two machine-guns in our hands. Throughout the day the enemy maintained
a heavy harassing fire, and in the evening again attempted a bombing
attack on Beatty and Babs posts, but with the same result. The
following day the shelling decreased considerably, and inter-company
relief was carried out. First Lieutenant W. B. Evans, U.S.A.M.O.R.C.,
and Captain the Rev. J. O. Venables, in addition to 27 other ranks,
were gassed on the 13th, and every day there were a number of men
killed, wounded, and gassed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 15th the following letter from Brigadier-General W. S. Osborn,
5th Infantry Brigade, was received by Brigadier-General Follett:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The 5th Infantry Brigade much appreciates the support given
them on their left by the 1st Batt. Grenadier Guards in
Beatty Post and Alban Trench. The counter-attack repulsed
by Grenadier Guardsmen would have fallen on their weakened
Companies. A captured map showed the Hun main line running
down Hunt Avenue with outposts in Slag Avenue, and the
counter-attack was evidently made to gain this resistance
line. Will you please thank Colonel Lord Gort from me on
behalf of the 5th I.B.</p></blockquote>

<p>The week preceding the attack on Premy Chapel was uneventful, and
on the 25th Major-General Matheson explained the details of the
operations. Captain Lawford was appointed to the Staff of the Fourth
Army, and Captain Lovell, M.C., took over the duties of Adjutant.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sept. 26.</div>

<p>On the evening of the 26th the Battalion left its billets about a mile
north-west of the village of Lagnicourt, and marched with its full
battle equipment, accompanied by Lewis guns, limbers, field-kitchens,
and water-carts, along the Lagnicourt&mdash;Doignies road, to its bivouacs
about 1500 yards west of Louverval Wood. The strength of the Battalion
was 15 officers and 395 other ranks actually going into action.</p>

<p>Lieut. R. W. F. Echlin was acting Brigade Transport Officer, and Lieut.
R. G. Buchanan as Quartermaster.</p>

<p>Lord Gort issued the following operation orders:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Battalion will attack Premy Chapel hill tomorrow the
27th, with the object of securing the line of the sunken road.</p>

<p>The attack will be made in conjunction with the 2/20th London
Regiment, who will be advancing on Marcoing, and the 2nd
Battalion Scots Guards, who will be attacking Leech Trench.</p>

<p>The strong patrols of the Battalion will debouch for the
attack from the line of the sunken road at zero + 4 hours 20
minutes so as to cross the brown line (Beet Trench) at zero +4
hours and 30 minutes. Approach march orders have been issued
separately.</p>

<p>The Battalion will attack with No. 2 Company on right and No.
4 Company on left in front line, preceded at a distance of 300
yards by strong patrols.</p>

<p>Dividing line between the two leading Companies in the attack
will be T of Beet Trench to A in Log Avenue, all inclusive to
No. 4 Company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>No. 3 Company will be in support écheloned behind No. 4
Company at a distance of 500 yards in readiness to make a
flank attack on Premy Hill from the north should it be found
necessary.</p>

<p>The King's Company will be in Battalion Reserve and will
follow No. 3 Company at a distance of 500 yards until the
neighbourhood of Premy Trench is reached, when it will occupy
suitable shell-holes and trenches.</p>

<p>Two Stokes mortars, each with 50 rounds, will move immediately
in rear of and under the command of the O.C. No. 3 Company.</p>

<p>One section machine-guns will follow in rear of the King's
Company and will be prepared to assist a flank attack on
Premy from the north with covering fire and to assist the
consolidation of Premy Hill by guns placed in the Graincourt
line.</p>

<p>Corps heavy artillery will bombard Premy Hill until zero + 5
hours, when the guns will lift on to Nine Wood for half an
hour and then cease firing.</p></blockquote>


<p>The remainder of the orders contained detailed instructions for the
action of the Battalion, if the attack on the right and left proved
successful.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sept. 27.</div>

<p>It was very dark when the Battalion started on its march, and the
artillery on both sides was very quiet. The order of march was No.
2 Company under Captain Carter, No. 4 under Lieutenant Jones, No.
3 under Captain Simpson, and the King's Company under Lieutenant
Brown, while Lord Gort, accompanied by Captain Lovell, the Adjutant,
and some orderlies, walked at the head of the Battalion. On reaching
the Bapaume&mdash;Cambrai road a halt was made to wait for zero hour,
5.20 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, at which time the Battalion was to advance
towards Flesquières. At zero hour the advance began across country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
to Demicourt. There was at first very little shelling, but as the
Battalion neared the Canal du Nord the shells began to fall more
rapidly. There was no water in the Canal, and by means of short ladders
placed against the banks the crossing was effected 100 yards north
of Lock Seven, with only a dozen casualties, including Lieutenant
Jesper, who was wounded as he reached the near bank. Lord Gort went
back to Lock Seven to confer with the officer commanding the tanks
which were to support the Battalion, and was unable to find him; it
was ascertained later that he had been wounded. The Battalion had to
be in position east of Flesquières at 9.20 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, and Lord
Gort therefore continued the advance without further delay. The ground
over which it was necessary to pass was undulating, and was swept by
the enemy's fire, but the skilful manner in which Lord Gort conducted
this advance accounted for the small number of casualties the Battalion
sustained. The situation did not look very promising, for the Germans
were still holding Graincourt some 4000 yards to the left rear. The
2nd Battalion was unable to advance on Orival Wood, which should have
been taken before the 1st Battalion started, and the Third Division,
through which the 1st Battalion had to advance, had failed to carry
Beet Trench. On nearing Flesquières, the enemy's machine-gun fire from
the direction of Graincourt became very heavy, and Captain Carter
was killed, being hit in the head. On reaching Flesquières Lord Gort
took the leading companies round the northern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span> edge of the village,
threading a way through the houses, as the machine-gun fire was heavy
from the left flank. Two enemy batteries were still in action in the
neighbourhood of Beet Trench, and the Germans were also holding the
Beetroot Factory and Beet Trench very strongly with infantry and
machine-guns. No sign of any troops on the left could be seen, and
tanks, which were to co-operate, had not yet arrived. Lord Gort himself
took the leading platoons of the two leading companies into position
for assault, and while doing so was slightly wounded over the left
eye. While the patrol platoon of No. 2 Company was crawling forward to
locate the exact position of the enemy, Second Lieutenant Clarke, with
the patrol platoon of No. 4 Company, worked round the left flank of the
enemy, captured Beetroot Factory, and took the garrison prisoners. It
was a skilful and daring man&#339;uvre, as the platoon was fired at from
both flanks, and suffered heavily. One tank now arrived, and Lord Gort
at once decided to push on towards Premy Chapel, in spite of the fact
that no corresponding advance seemed to have been begun on either flank.</p>

<p>Second Lieutenant Clarke, who had returned with his prisoners, was now
ordered to take a platoon from No. 3 Company in support, and again work
round the left flank in order to attack Beet Trench from the rear. Lord
Gort went across the open to a tank, that was working behind the sunken
road, and showed the Commander where to cross, and in what direction to
advance; but when it neared Beet Trench the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span> tank was put out of action
by direct artillery fire. It was now found that the 2nd Battalion Scots
Guards, which should have been advancing on the left flank, was not in
position, nor was the 2nd Battalion Grenadier Guards able to advance on
Orival Wood. On the right the situation was better, for the Sixty-third
Division was reported to be making good progress. The 1st Battalion
Welsh Guards, which was in Brigade Reserve, undertook to come up and
protect the left flank. All the time there were several hostile air
balloons up directing the fire on the tank, and a German aeroplane had
signalled the presence of troops in the sunken road, which immediately
became a target for the enemy's artillery. One shell burst close to
Lord Gort, wounding him severely in the arm, but although an artery
had been cut and he lost a great deal of blood, he refused to go back
to the dressing-station, and asked Captain Lindsay to bind his arm up
temporarily.</p>

<p>His wound, however, proved more serious than he thought, and Captain
Simpson took over command of the Battalion. Somewhat later Lord Gort
insisted on starting off again to join the leading companies, but on
reaching Beet Trench he collapsed from loss of blood.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the platoon of No. 3 Company under Second Lieutenant Clarke
had succeeded in their turning movement, captured a German machine-gun
post, and, in spite of being fired on by our tank, worked round to the
east of Beet Trench. Two hundred Germans were driven into the sunken
road, and forced to surrender,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span> while two batteries of field howitzers
and six machine-guns were captured.</p>

<p>The two leading companies continued their advance and No. 3 Company
moved forward in their support in échelon to their left flank, while
the King's Company moved up to the sunken road in reserve. The enemy
was now shelling the neighbourhood of Beet Trench, and sweeping the
whole ground with machine-gun fire. No. 2 Company reached Labour
Trench, leaving two platoons in support in Premy Trench, but in the
face of point-blank artillery fire from Nine Wood was unable to advance
any farther. Lieutenant A. A. Morris, who was the only officer left
with the company, was killed while advancing with the leading platoons.
Second Lieutenant A. Grant in No. 4 Company was killed about the same
time, while Lieutenant B. Jones was wounded.</p>

<p>The enemy was holding Marcoing on the right flank and a spur by Leech
Alley on the left, so that the whole attack had become wedge-shaped,
and, while no advance was taking place on either flank, the 1st
Battalion continued to drive this wedge into the enemy's lines. But
however successful or daring a man&#339;uvre like this may be, its
ultimate success depends on the knowledge when to stop. In answer to a
message sent by Captain Simpson, Brigadier-General de Crespigny said
that any farther advance was not to be attempted in the face of such
heavy fire, until the left flank had been secured by the advance of
fresh troops through Graincourt. Captain Simpson decided to establish
the main line of resistance in Beet Trench, with a line of outposts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
pushed well in front, to act as a screen for the advance of the
Second Division, which was known to be advancing. Accordingly No. 2
Company was withdrawn to Premy Support Trench, No. 3 to the gun-pit and
Beetroot Factory, and the King's and No. 4 Companies to Beet Trench,
with outposts some 300 yards in front. This man&#339;uvre was carried
out under heavy fire, but was executed with such steadiness that the
casualties were few. The men, however, seemed disappointed that they
could not push farther on. The Adjutant, Captain Lovell, was hit by a
machine-gun bullet whilst accompanying Captain Simpson, who had gone up
to superintend the movement.</p>

<p>The Germans appear to have been thoroughly mystified by this attack
throughout the whole operation, and to have imagined that the advance
might eventually develop into a turning movement, threatening their
line of retreat. When the Second Division came up at 2.30, they found
the enemy retreating everywhere before them. As soon as the advance had
been begun by this Division, the 1st Battalion was withdrawn to an area
west of the Canal.</p>

<p>The extraordinary success achieved by the Battalion during this attack
was entirely due to the courage, endurance, and determination of Lord
Gort, who was awarded the V.C. for his conspicuous bravery. He was able
by his example and the reckless exposure of his own life to infuse
into all ranks an indomitable determination to reach the objective, no
matter what the cost might be. He had himself brought the Battalion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
to a very high state of efficiency, and there is little doubt that
with a less highly trained battalion such an attack might have ended
disastrously.</p>

<p>The casualties incurred during this attack were: Killed, Captain J.
S. Carter, Lieutenant A. A. Morris, and Second Lieutenant A. Grant;
wounded, Lieut.-Colonel Lord Gort, Captain W. H. Lovell, Lieutenant B.
H. Jones, Lieutenant A. M. Brown, Second Lieutenant J. C. Blunt, Second
Lieutenant L. C. Jesper; and amongst other ranks there were 35 killed
and 24 wounded.</p>

<p>The last days in September were spent by the Battalion reorganising
and re-fitting in bivouacs west of Canal du Nord, when the following
officers arrived: Captain P. M. Spence, M.C., Lieutenant C. G.
Kennaway, Lieutenant R. S. Challands, Lieutenant A. M. Brown, Second
Lieutenant M. G. Farquharson, Second Lieutenant E. A. D. Bliss, Second
Lieutenant N. P. Andrews, Second Lieutenant J. C. Blunt, and Second
Lieutenant R. B. Osborne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2nd Batt.</div>

<p>During the first week in September the Battalion near Adinfer was
training and reorganising, after the heavy losses incurred in the
operations at the end of August. From the 7th to 11th the Battalion,
under Major Harcourt-Vernon, went up into the front line, where it
came in for much shelling, especially from gas-shells, and, although
the troops on each flank carried out offensive operations, it was not
called upon to attack. After ten days spent out of the line,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span> during
which Second Lieutenant K. B. Bibby and Second Lieutenant E. M. Neill
joined, the Battalion moved up to Llama Post.</p>

<p>During the night rain fell, and the tracks were, in consequence, very
slippery. This, added to the fact that some of the bridges which had
been put across the trenches on the previous day had been broken,
caused some delay, and prevented the pack animals, which were following
the companies with hot food containers, from keeping up with the
Battalion; they were consequently sent round by road, but failed to
arrive before the companies left their assembly positions. The enemy's
artillery was exceptionally quiet during the march, and only a few
shells fell in Boursies, as the Battalion passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span> through. Walsh Trench
and Walsh Support were reached at 4.30 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span></p>

<p>The general plan of attack was as follows: Sergison-Brooke's Brigade
was to take the first objective, which was the Hindenburg support line
between Graincourt and Flesquières. The 1st Battalion Irish Guards
was then to pass through and take the second objective, which was the
old British front line of December 1917 to March 1918, just north of
Flesquières. The 2nd Battalion Grenadier Guards was to follow the Irish
Guards, and pass through them in order to exploit any success gained
towards Orival Wood and Graincourt, while Follett's Brigade on the
right would push on towards Nine Wood.</p>

<p>The Battalion moved off at zero plus one hour from its assembly
position, in the normal approach formation with No. 1 Company under
Captain Hermon-Hodge, and No. 2 under Lieutenant Dent in the front
line, and Nos. 3 and 4 Companies under Lieutenant Palmer and Captain
Drummond in support. The ridge west of the Canal du Nord was being
heavily shelled, but the Battalion passed over it with few casualties,
and crossed the Canal itself easily enough with the aid of ladders on
each bank. Any advance through the intricate labyrinth of trenches
in the Hindenburg line was by no means a simple matter, especially
under fire, and the instructions Major Harcourt-Vernon received were
to bring up the Battalion to Soap Trench and Ship Trench in the
Hindenburg support line, and then to advance to the forming-up area.
The Battalion was unable to leave the Hindenburg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span> support line until
8.20 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, partly on account of No. 4 Company having lost
direction, and being engaged by machine-gun fire from the left, and
partly on account of Summer Lane not having been completely cleared of
the enemy. In order to deal with this machine-gun nest in Summer Lane,
Major Harcourt-Vernon despatched one platoon under Second Lieutenant
Pelly with orders to clear the Germans out. Second Lieutenant Pelly
successfully carried out his orders, and not only chased the Germans
away, but also took eight prisoners. The advance was then continued,
but a heavy fire from the direction of Graincourt and Knave Trench
caused many casualties, and Second Lieutenant Pelly was wounded. The
mopping up had not been very thorough, and some casualties occurred
from snipers' bullets from the rear.</p>

<p>The Third Division had taken Flesquières, but the Sixty-third Division
had failed to occupy Graincourt, with the result that the Germans
were able to enfilade the troops advancing to Flesquières. When the
Battalion advanced to the Beetroot Factory, two batteries of field-guns
fired at them with open sights, and machine-guns from Graincourt swept
the ground over which they had to pass. On reaching the Beetroot
Factory, the Company Commanders at once sent out patrols to make
good the ground towards Orival Wood, and silence the batteries and
machine-guns, which were causing the casualties, but the volume and
accuracy of the enemy's fire prevented them from making much headway.
Lieutenant Combe and Lieutenant Bevan were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span> wounded, whilst trying to
push forward with patrols, and there seemed no prospect of advancing
until Graincourt had been captured.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the situation underwent a change owing to Lord Gort's
daring advance with the 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards. This had the
effect of moving the whole German line. Graincourt was at last taken,
and an advance on Orival Wood was begun. About 4.30 the Second Division
began to arrive, and in conjunction with the King's Regiment advanced
from Flesquières. This enabled the 2nd Battalion to push through Orival
Wood, although it was unable to debouch from its north edge. Lieutenant
Sharpe was wounded during this advance. The Battalion succeeded in
capturing seven field-guns and three howitzers, in addition to some
forty prisoners. Later in the evening the Fifty-seventh Division
attempted to attack down the Graincourt&mdash;Marcoing Road, and met with
little success.</p>

<p>The Battalion was withdrawn at 3 o'clock the next morning, and returned
to a camp on the west of the Canal. The casualties were not heavy. The
Battalion lost 9 men killed, 86 wounded, and 2 missing, in addition to
the 4 officers already mentioned as having been wounded.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">The 3rd Battalion</h3>

<div class="sidenote">3rd Batt.</div>

<p>On the 24th the Battalion moved back to Ransart, and reorganised the
companies which had suffered. Lieutenant J. A. Inglis-Jones joined on
the 31st. Lieut.-Colonel Thorne left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span> to take over command of the Ninth
Corps School, and was succeeded by Major Viscount Lascelles.</p>

<p>On September 1 a warning order was received that the Brigade would take
part in an attack, and the following morning the Battalion marched to
Hamelincourt. Under the impression that it would stay there for the
night, Lord Lascelles gave the men orders to collect material in the
ruins of the village, bivouac, and cook their dinners; but bivouacking
took rather longer than was expected, and just when dinners were
cooked, orders were received for the Battalion to move at once to
L'Homme Mort, near St. Leger. The result was that the men had a hurried
meal. At a Brigade conference that was held, verbal orders for the
attack were issued, and it was decided that, rather than risk finding
pockets of Germans within the forming-up positions, it would be safer
to ignore the advance made that morning, and form up on ground that had
been in our possession for several days.</p>

<p>At 1 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> the leading company started for the assembly
positions, and although the guide twice lost his way it arrived at the
destination at 3 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> An hour later Lord Lascelles went round
the positions and could find no trace of the other three companies. At
5.5 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, the hour at which the Battalion was to advance, they
arrived, having been on the march for four hours, owing to inefficient
guides.</p>

<p>The Germans had meanwhile decided not to wait for the attack and had
already retired when the Battalion commenced to advance, so that there
was no fighting. When No. 1 and No. 2<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span> Companies, under Captain Fryer
and Captain Dury, reached the final objective, it was merely a matter
of rounding up a certain number of deserters. Lord Lascelles, on going
up to the leading companies, found a stretch of undulating country in
front with no sign of the enemy, and ordered an advance to the next
ridge, at the same time directing No. 3 Company, under Lieutenant
Cornish in support, and No. 4 Company, under Captain Hirst in reserve,
to move forward as far as the position already occupied by the leading
companies. This sweeping advance with no apparent opposition somewhat
confused the leading companies, which were accustomed during the long
period of trench warfare to short advances with definite objectives.</p>

<p>The fatigue of the men was beginning to tell, and this last advance
was a distinct effort, but by two o'clock in the afternoon the
leading companies had consolidated the position in Boursies. There
were no casualties, although the enemy put up a few shells over the
Battalion, as it topped the ridge 500 yards west of the village.
During the afternoon the German artillery became very busy, and
interfered a good deal with the patrols, but otherwise caused little
or no damage. The men had been on the move since dawn the day before,
and were consequently exhausted, but the Germans made no attempt to
counter-attack, and it was therefore possible to get some rest.</p>

<p>At 5 o'clock the following morning the 3rd Guards Brigade passed
through the Battalion, which was withdrawn to watch the exposed right
flank. The visibility was good, and a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span> sentries were all that were
required, while the remainder of the Battalion obtained some rest. On
the 5th the Battalion relieved the Welsh Guards in the front line,
and Lord Lascelles decided to move the Battalion Headquarters farther
forward, and to hand over what had been the Welsh Guards Headquarters
to the Medical Officer for an aid-post. Nos. 3 and 4 Companies were
placed in the front line, with Nos. 1 and 2 in support. The right of
the Battalion was not in touch with any troops, there being a gap of
some 500 yards, and this was accounted for by the fact that the ground
was covered with wire of the old Hindenburg line and of the old British
line facing it. This wire was almost impenetrable laterally, and was
at right angles to the line held by the Battalion. The enemy was in
considerable strength in front, and held some 400 yards west of the
Canal du Nord as an outpost line in the old maze of trenches, with a
strong defensive position behind the Canal. The ground sloped down to
the Canal, and the farther the Battalion advanced, the more they were
overlooked from the opposite slope; but the necessity of gaining touch
with the 1st Battalion King's Royal Rifles made an advance necessary.
The line of resistance, about 600 yards behind the front line, which
the Battalion received instructions to dig, was nearly finished, when
the enemy put a concentrated gas bombardment on the valley, where the
Company Headquarters of the two companies in support were placed. For
an hour the Germans bombarded the valley with sneezing-gas shells,
and all the officers and men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span> kept on their masks, but when the gas
bombardment appeared to cease and was succeeded by one of H.E. shells,
every one incautiously took off his mask. This new bombardment proved
to be one of mustard gas. By the time this was realised every one was
being sick, and all the officers and N.C.O.'s were casualties. Lord
Lascelles came up from Battalion Headquarters to see what had happened,
and met Captain Dury being led away blind. There were 61 men in No. 1
Company and 30 men in No. 2 who had been gassed, in addition to the
following officers: Second Lieutenant S. Calvocoressi, Captain G. Dury,
Second Lieutenant W. B. L. Manley, Lieutenant H. P. Gordon, and Second
Lieutenant R. K. Henderson.</p>

<p>In the meantime Lieutenant Cornish, commanding No. 3 Company, had
received orders from Lord Lascelles to close the gap on his right, and
after reconnoitring the situation had established a liaison post with
the King's Royal Rifles at Joan Post. When darkness came he managed
to send out more men, and added two fresh posts south of Goat Trench;
but the ground to be covered was over 500 yards, and the difficulty
was that the line from the right of the Battalion to the left of the
King's Royal Rifles ran diagonally over a crest, and not parallel to
it. Lines of very thick and strong wire ran in irregular lines, and in
various directions. What therefore seemed fairly simple by daylight was
extremely difficult in the dark, since no patrol could keep direction
on account of the wire. A compass was useless, owing to the wire, and
there were no land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>marks. Lord Lascelles, who was not at all happy
about his right flank, ordered Lieutenant Cornish to double his liaison
post, and to put up a Véry light perpendicular at dusk from his post on
the left of the gap, so that a detachment from the liaison post could
work towards it.</p>

<p>These measures, although far from satisfactory, were the best that
could be done in the circumstances, and Lieutenant Cornish was
afterwards highly commended for the energy and resource which he showed
in dealing with an admittedly difficult situation.</p>

<p>On the 8th the Battalion was relieved by the 2nd Battalion Grenadiers,
and retired to some trenches in Dunhelm Avenue. From the 8th to the
15th the whole of the 2nd Brigade went into reserve positions near
Lagnicourt, where no incidents of any importance occurred. As a draft
was shortly expected, the companies were not equalised in strength, but
it was Nos. 1 and 2 Companies that had suffered most, and, as the other
two companies would have to lead the attack at the end of the month,
there was no objection to the half-assimilated draft being in reserve.</p>

<p>On the 20th the Battalion was warned that it would shortly have to take
part in the attack on the Canal du Nord, and that it would relieve
the 1st Battalion Scots Guards on the night of the 21st. A piece of
ground was at once selected for practice purposes, and the enemy's
trenches and salient features were taped out on it, while the Royal
Engineers constructed a model of the area to be attacked. The expected
draft arrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span> just in time to take part in the rehearsal, and was
absorbed in Nos. 1 and 2 Companies. The following day after a Company
Commanders' conference, the details of the attack were carefully
explained by the Commanding Officer, Lord Lascelles, who had attended
a conference at Brigade Headquarters. No. 3 Company and one platoon of
No. 4 were to attack Slag Heap; the remainder of No. 4 Company would
be in support; No. 2 Company would remain where it was in the front
line, and No. 1 would be in Brigade Reserve. Thus all four companies
were to be more or less in the front line, but No. 4 Company, under
Lieutenant Bunbury, was the one most likely to come into touch with the
enemy. During the relief No. 4 Company was raided, but the Welsh Guards
had not yet left the line, and the enemy consequently received a very
warm reception. The possibility of an attack on that part of the line
had already occurred to Lieutenant Bunbury, as a similar raid had been
attempted two days before, and the ground being a regular rabbit-warren
of disused trenches made it extremely difficult to guard against a
surprise; but he kept his company constantly on the alert, and was
ready for the Germans when they came.</p>

<p>On the 25th a heavy barrage descended on the whole front line, and
all wires became disconnected. The enemy raided the position of the
line occupied by No. 4 Company, and managed to get into trenches at
an unoccupied spot, but were ejected by a patrol. There were a few
casualties from the barrage, but no men missing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span> On the following day
detailed orders for the attack were issued, and the Battalion proceeded
to the assembly position.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sept. 27.</div>

<p>The attack of the Battalion was at right angles to the main attack,
which was somewhat confusing; but, as the Battalion was holding a
salient, it was necessary to have the right half Battalion facing east,
one company facing north, and one company (in échelon) facing east.
There was still a pocket of Germans on the left between the Battalion
and the Canal, but the ground was heavily wired and quite impassable.
It was therefore necessary to attack northward, and as there were
many lines of trenches and much wire, the attack had to be organised
in small parties,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span> working over the top of the ground but parallel
with the trenches, so that the wire might be crossed by entering
the trenches. Each party was in charge of an officer or a specially
selected non-commissioned officer, and although there was undoubtedly a
risk of losing many first-rate men, this decision was justified by the
fact that, in spite of the maze of trenches, none of the parties failed
to reach their objectives.</p>

<p>No. 3 Company, under Lieutenant de Geijer, reached Slag Heap, and got
touch with the 1st Battalion Coldstream. An aid-post was established
there, and parties began to move up Donkey and Dog Trench, when the
Coldstream reported that they were suffering heavy casualties from
their left flank. Instructions were at once sent by Lord Lascelles
to keep down the machine-gun fire referred to, but the Battalion was
itself subjected to a heavy fire from two machine-guns, which swept
most of the ground crossed by carrying parties, and caused casualties
among unsuspecting troops in rear. Two Stokes mortars were ordered up,
but as soon as the Germans saw them coming into position they retired.
Lance-Corporal Watson crossed the Canal with Private Parry in order to
silence another machine-gun (probably the gun which was harassing the
Coldstream), and succeeded in capturing not only the gun but an officer
and seven men near Kangaroo Trench. Second Lieutenant Gibbon with three
men took half a dozen prisoners, and sent them back down a trench. As
the last German disappeared round the traverse, he treacherously drew
a bomb from his pocket and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span> threw it at Second Lieutenant Gibbon and
his men, who had just enough time to run round another traverse. No. 3
Company took 83 prisoners, including the wounded, and 23 machine-guns,
and their casualties were not heavy, for they only had 12 men wounded
and 2 missing. In the evening verbal orders were received to move back
to Doignies.</p>

<p class="center p-left sm">OCTOBER</p>

<p class="center p-left"><i>Diary of the War</i></p>


<div class="sidenote">Oct. 1918.</div>

<p>In France the German retirement continued, and the British Army made
considerable progress, while the French were equally successful in
hastening the retreat of the enemy near St. Quentin and later at
Soissons. King Albert's attack threatened to cut off part of the
German Army in Belgium, and in order to prevent this, the Germans were
forced to retire precipitately, leaving behind them vast stores of war
material. Ostend, Lille, and Douai were evacuated, and Sir Roger Keyes,
who commanded what was known as the Dover Patrol, landed on the Belgian
coast. The German intention appears to have been to retire from Belgium
as speedily as possible, and in so doing to avoid any large number of
men being surrounded.</p>

<p>In Italy the Austrians were in full retreat, and on the 27th sued for
Peace.</p>

<p>In Palestine General Allenby, after a series of brilliant operations,
succeeded in cutting off the main portion of the Turkish Army on the
Tigris, with the result that Turkey asked for an Armistice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>


<h3 class="smcap">The Guards Division</h3>

<p>In October the Germans found the retirement more and more difficult.
During September they had lost a quarter of a million prisoners and
an immense number of guns, and their original intention of making a
determined stand on one of their deeply fortified lines had long since
been abandoned. The Allied Armies were pressing them back all along
the line, and the continual retirement was beginning to affect the
spirit of the Army. After the Siegfried line had been broken through,
Sir Douglas Haig commenced operations on a seventeen-mile front from
Cambrai to Sequehart with the Third and Fourth Armies, and the Sixth
Corps, in which the Guards Division was, advanced to the south of
Cambrai.</p>

<p>On October 6 Major-General Matheson received a warning order to be
prepared to move to Havrincourt, but this move was postponed later for
twenty-four hours. The Guards Division was in support of the Second
and Third Divisions, and in the event of little opposition being
encountered was to pass through and continue the advance on La Henières
and Igniel-dit-les-Frisettes, but as the Germans offered a stubborn
resistance the Guards Division did not go into the line until the next
day.</p>

<p>All sorts of wild rumours were about, and as there seemed every danger
of the enemy making use of them to gain time, Major-General Matheson
issued the following order:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) Rumours are current that the German Government intends
to propose a suspension of hostilities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span> with a view to the
discussion of Peace terms. It is possible that attempts at
fraternisation may in consequence be made by German troops in
the line.</p>

<p>(2) The German Army is hard pressed and the German High
Command needs time to carry out its present withdrawal without
heavy loss in men and material. German Peace talk is therefore
circulated in order to relax our pressure, gain time for the
withdrawal, and prepare for a long defensive campaign next
year.</p>

<p>(3) All our troops will be warned against paying any attention
to rumours of this kind. They are intended not to shorten
the war but to save the German Army from the consequences of
defeat this year and to preserve its strength for the defence
of German soil next year. Any attempts made by the enemy to
fraternise in the field will also be disregarded absolutely.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is our intention to beat the enemy as fast as we can, not to allow
him to recover his strength.</p>

<p>On the morning of October 9 De Crespigny's Brigade on the right, and
Sergison-Brooke's Brigade on the left, passed through the Third and
Second Divisions, and attacked under a barrage.</p>

<p>It was expected that the Caudry&mdash;Cambrai railway, running diagonally
across the line of advance, with its steep embankments and deep
cuttings, would form a serious obstacle, and special steps were taken
to bring enfilade artillery and machine-gun fire to bear on it, till
the infantry was within assaulting distance. It was soon found,
however, that the enemy had withdrawn during the night, and it was not
till late in the afternoon that the German advanced troops were again
located, holding a line of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span> trenches west of Boistrancourt and east of
Igniel-dit-les-Frisettes. A night operation to capture Boistrancourt
revealed the farther withdrawal of the enemy.</p>

<p>On the 10th De Crespigny's and Sergison-Brooke's Brigades followed up
the enemy, and after some skirmishing with his rear-guards, took up an
outpost line west of Quevy and St. Hilaire, with detached posts east of
those villages.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 11th the 3rd Guards Brigade, which was now under
the command of Brigadier-General Heywood, passed through the outposts,
and was soon engaged with the German rear-guards, which were now
fighting stubbornly.</p>

<p>The next few days were spent in clearing the enemy from the west bank
of the River Selle, after which there was a pause to allow time for
the reconstruction of the railways in rear. The most difficult problem
of this period was the evacuation of the civil population from the
villages on the banks of the Selle, which were occupied by both our own
and the enemy's troops. The evacuation was carried out by night with
scarcely a casualty.</p>

<p>On the 20th the Guards Division took part in a general attack, launched
with the object of driving the enemy from his new positions, east of
the River Selle. The attack, which started at 1 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, was
carried out by De Crespigny's Brigade on the right, and Heywood's
Brigade on the left. The Sixty-second Division was to clear Solesmes
of the enemy on the right of the Guards Division, and the Nineteenth
Division was to capture Haussy on the left. A great deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span> of the
success of this attack depended on whether the River Selle was held in
any strength, but the Germans never attempted to dispute the passage,
and both Brigades passed over with little loss. The first objective
was secured without difficulty, but when the advance to the second
objective commenced, a good deal of opposition was encountered,
especially on the left, where the Nineteenth Division had been held
up after capturing Haussy. The resistance was so stubborn that at one
time artillery preparation was contemplated; but when the Sixty-second
Division advanced towards Romeries, the Guards Division was able to
secure the second objective, and even push out patrols as far as the
River Harpies.</p>

<p>During the afternoon the Germans put down on the new positions an
artillery concentration, which many officers present considered to have
been the heaviest they had experienced since the battle of the Somme;
our troops were, however, so well dug in that hardly any casualties
were inflicted. On the night of the 22nd the Division was relieved by
the Second Division, which continued the attack the following day.</p>

<p>The remainder of the month was spent in rest, which was, however, much
interfered with by the constant change of quarters, necessitated by the
withdrawal of the enemy.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">The 1st Battalion</h3>

<div class="sidenote">1st Batt.</div>

<p>At the beginning of October Major the Hon. W. R. Bailey arrived, and
took command of the Battalion. On the 7th orders were received to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
proceed to Havrincourt, where the Guards Division was to be in reserve
during an attack by the Second and Third Divisions. The attack proved
successful, and on the evening of the 8th the Battalion moved to
Marcoing, where it was bivouacked in some old trenches. On the 9th the
1st and 2nd Guards Brigade attacked, and the 3rd Guards Brigade was
in Divisional Reserve. The Battalion marched by platoons at 100 yards
intervals to Seranvillers <i>via</i> Masnières and Crevecour. The next
day it moved on to Cattenières, and Major Bailey, accompanied by the
Company Commanders, rode on to Bévillers to reconnoitre.</p>

<p>On the 11th the Battalion moved off at 1 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, and reached
the rendezvous just east of Bévillers at 4 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> It was a very
dark night, drizzling with rain, and the marching was difficult owing
to the mine craters, with which the enemy had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span> endeavoured to destroy
the road, transport wagons constantly falling in, and delaying the
march. The Battalion had been allotted a front of about 2000 yards,
which was covered by the King's Company under Captain Spence on the
right, and No. 2 Company under Lieutenant Kennaway on the left, each
with two platoons in the front line acting as fighting patrols, and two
platoons in the second line with the Company Commanders. No. 3 Company
under Captain Simpson was in support, and No. 4 under Lieutenant Bliss
in Brigade Reserve. The country was quite open with no cover at all,
and consisted of grass and stubble fields. The gently undulating ground
was particularly favourable to the Germans, who were past-masters in
the art of fighting rear-guard actions. At 5 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> the advance
began. The first bound was to the railway east of the village of
Quiévy, but no halt was made here, as it was found that the advanced
troops of the 1st Guards Brigade had pushed farther on during the
night. When the leading patrols reached the high ground immediately
east of Quiévy, they were met by heavy machine-gun fire from the
orchard north of Fontaine-au-terre Farm, and were enfiladed by numerous
machine-guns along the St. Vaast&mdash;Solesmes road. The leading companies
deployed here. The King's and No. 2 Companies, covered by their own
fire, continued to advance by rushes, and captured the orchard, from
which the Germans hastily retired. Captain Simpson halted No. 3 Company
on the high ground west of the farm, while south of the farm touch
was gained with the 2nd Bat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>talion Auckland Regiment from the New
Zealand Division. The machine-gun fire from the left flank, where the
Scots Guards were checked, continued to be very severe, and completely
held up No. 2 Company. Captain Spence decided to push forward with
the King's Company to try and outflank the enemy's posts, and sent
forward one platoon down the slope. Although this had the desired
effect, and the German infantry retired, they left their machine-guns,
which kept up a sweeping fire along the crest, and prevented the Scots
Guards from advancing. It was thought that, if a demonstration was
made straight towards them, it might perhaps force them to retire,
but when No. 2 Company attempted this the German machine-guns never
moved. Meanwhile the King's Company, with that dogged determination
which has characterised all its movements during the war, drove away
the Germans from the spur of the hill south of Solesmes, and working
round in the area occupied by the New Zealand Division, pushed forward,
and gained the spur itself. The ground over which the King's Company
passed, consisted of a deep and broad valley quite devoid of cover,
and the slightest movement could be observed from the opposite slope,
where German field-guns and machine-guns were posted. The manner in
which Captain Spence directed his company and surmounted all the
difficulties, was specially mentioned by Lieut.-Colonel Bailey, and
this advance undoubtedly made a considerable difference to the centre
of the Guards Division. But the forward position, which the King's
Company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span> had gained, was by no means easy to retain, for the men were
subjected to a heavy machine-gun fire from the north, whilst the
enemy's 5·9 guns registered on them. These men remained unable to
move a muscle until dark, when they dug themselves in. No. 3 Company
was moved up to an orchard in close support, and, as there seemed no
reasonable prospect of success during daylight without heavy loss,
it was not pushed up into the attack. The German machine-guns were
wonderfully well placed, commanding the flat plateaus on the top
of the ridges, with no possibility of their being approached under
cover, and our artillery was unable to help, as it was practically
impossible to locate these machine-gun nests. The men were anxious
to push on, and had to be restrained. All this time the shelling was
heavy but promiscuous, and several men were hit by fragments. Captain
Simpson, Second Lieutenant Clarke, and Second Lieutenant Osborne were
wounded in this way, but the Battalion was really very fortunate in
not having suffered more than it did. Although patrols were sent out
during the night, they were unable to get very far on account of the
enemy's machine-guns, which had evidently been pushed forward to hinder
reconnaissance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oct. 12.</div>

<p>The next morning it was found that the Germans had retired, and that
the machine-guns had all been withdrawn, the emplacements being full
of empty cartridge cases. Except for some shelling the morning proved
uneventful, and in the afternoon the 2nd Battalion Scots Guards and
1st Battalion Welsh Guards were ordered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span> attack on the left. Two
platoons from No. 2 Company of the 1st Battalion were ordered to
co-operate with them and guard their right flank. The advance was
successfully carried out with little opposition, although the German
artillery put down a heavy barrage on the west line. The company
runners in this fight behaved with great gallantry, and throughout
the day carried their lives in their hands, continually running great
risks. Posts were ordered to be pushed down to the railway, and small
reconnoitring patrols were sent out as soon as it was dark. Except
at the commencement of the operations the Battalion saw few Germans,
and the men realised they were fighting a very cleverly hidden enemy.
Each machine-gun nest had to be located, and shot out in turn. During
that night the King's Company was relieved by No. 4, and No. 3 by No.
2. Lieutenant Challands, who took over command of No. 3 Company, was
knocked out temporarily by the bursting of a shell during the relief.
The Battalion was the only one in the Division to reach its objective,
and this was entirely due to the dash displayed by both officers and
men in this entirely new form of open warfare.</p>

<p>The 2nd Battalion Scots Guards and 1st Battalion Welsh Guards advanced
up to the same line, held by the 1st Battalion Grenadiers. The rest of
the day was very trying for all troops in the forward area on account
of the continual shelling, as the Germans had excellent observation,
and were very accurate in their shooting. The line from Solesmes to
St. Python was very strongly held, and the two posts on the right
held by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span> Battalion were in dangerous proximity to the enemy. One
of these was rushed by a party of eighty Germans under cover of an
intense Minenwerfer barrage, and only one man escaped. In the evening
the Battalion was relieved by the 2nd Battalion Coldstream Guards, and
marched by companies to Quiévy. The casualties during the three days'
operations were 3 officers wounded, and of other ranks 11 were killed,
3 died of wounds, 45 wounded and 17 missing.</p>

<p>The next day Major Bailey received the following message from
Brigadier-General C. P. Heywood, Commanding the 3rd Guards Brigade:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I should like to put on record my appreciation of the good
work done by you and your Battalion during the past three
days. I was particularly impressed with the initiative and
determined action of the King's Company in pushing forward on
the afternoon of the 11th to the advanced position in D 12
central.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 15th Major-General T. G. Matheson, Commanding the Guards
Division, addressed the following message to Brigadier-General Heywood:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I wish to congratulate the Brigadier and all ranks of the 3rd
Guards Brigade on the manner in which they carried out the
task assigned to them from October 11th to 14th.</p>

<p>The advance of the 1st Batt. Grenadier Guards towards Solesmes
and of the 2nd Batt. Scots Guards to St. Python were carried
out with very much gallantry and produced very valuable
results in securing us command of the crossings of the River
Selle. The hard fighting of the 1st Batt. Welsh Guards on the
left flank contributed largely to the success of the other two
Battalions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>I am much pleased with the performance of the Brigade and
should like my appreciation to be conveyed to all ranks.</p></blockquote>

<p>Two days, the 14th and 15th, were spent at Quiévy cleaning up and
reorganising, but on the evening of the second day the enemy bombarded
the billeting area with 8-inch shells, when two men were killed and
nine were wounded. On the 17th the Battalion marched to Carmières,
where Major Bailey attended a Brigade conference. On the 19th the
Battalion marched by companies with intervals of 200 yards to St.
Vaast, and sheltered in houses and cellars until 10.15 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>,
when they moved up to the assembly area, directed by guides from the
1st Battalion Coldstream Guards.</p>

<p>The night was dark and it was pouring with rain, when the Battalion
formed up along the line of railway between Haussy and St. Vaast. It is
impossible adequately to describe the absolute wretchedness of forming
up on a pitch-dark night in pouring rain. An operation seemed hopeless,
and was only possible by giving careful instructions to every single
man in the Battalion. Plenty of time was allowed to prepare for this
fight, but the Battalion was only just ready when the time came to
advance. No. 4 Company, under Lieutenant Bliss, was on the left; No. 3
Company, under Lieutenant Challands, in the centre; and No. 2 Company,
under Lieutenant Kennaway, on the right. Touch was obtained with the
8th Battalion Gloucester Regiment in the Nineteenth Division on the
left, and with the Irish Guards on the right. The Royal Engineeers had
arranged to lay tapes from the railway to the eight temporary bridges,
which they had put over the River Selle, but these tapes were not laid
until shortly before zero hour, and one tape did not lead to a bridge,
with the result that the platoon which followed it had to wade across
the river.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oct. 20.</div>

<p>From the very start everything went well, and the barrage moved with
perfect precision. Chasing the Germans in the dark in this way was
not without excitement, as no one knew whether they would remain and
fight, or retire as soon as they were threatened. It was a great relief
to Major Bailey to find that the enemy had no intention of disputing
the crossing of the river, as this would have entailed the loss of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
a number of men at the start. As it was, the Battalion proceeded in
artillery formation as far as the Haussy&mdash;Solesmes road, passing over
five or six lines of rifle-pits wonderfully well made in concrete. When
the creeping barrage began to move forward, the Battalion moved with
it, but there was little or no opposition, and the objective was gained
according to scheduled time. The few prisoners that were captured said
that the garrisons of their posts had fled as soon as the barrage
began. Direction was admirably kept, and the men advanced close up
to the barrage, in spite of the heavy plough on the side of the hill
on which they had to advance. The 2nd Battalion Scots Guards and 1st
Battalion Welsh Guards then came through, and continued the advance. In
the evening the German artillery put down a very heavy barrage on the
railway, shifting it later to the road, and then covering the objective
and the reverse slope of the hill, but in spite of the shelling the
casualties were not heavy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oct. 21.</div>

<p>The shelling continued all the next day, but the 3rd Guards Brigade was
not required. In the evening the Battalion took over the whole Brigade
front from the Scots Guards and Welsh Guards; the King's and No. 3
Companies were placed in the outpost line; and Nos. 2 and 4 Companies
took over the main line of resistance on the high ground east of the
Solesmes&mdash;Vendegies road.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oct. 22.</div>

<p>The line of the Solesmes road was shelled all day, but the Battalion
was very lucky, although No. 4 Company was rather seriously gassed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Lieutenant E. A. D. Bliss and Second Lieutenant C. B. Hall and ten
men were all gassed. In the evening the Highland Light Infantry
relieved the Battalion, which marched back to billets in St. Vaast.
These operations on the whole had been easy, as the Germans had put
up very little resistance, but the rain and mud had made everything
very miserable, and the men were soaked to the skin before the attack
commenced.</p>

<p>In all the villages round about civilians emerged from cellars, having
hidden there for five days in order to avoid being evacuated by the
Germans. Among the German prisoners, who had been captured during the
advance, were several regimental commanders of the true Prussian type,
with florid faces and bristling moustaches. They presented a sorry
spectacle in the cages, and seemed to feel their position acutely.</p>

<p class="p2">On the 23rd the following special order was issued:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Commanding Officer congratulates all ranks on the way in
which the attack of the 20th was carried out. The difficulties
of a night attack are always great, but in this case they
were almost entirely eliminated by the obvious care with
which the officers and N.C.O.'s had made their preparations
and explained the scheme of attack to their men. No one lost
direction, and the orders given out beforehand were carried
out almost to the letter.</p>

<p>The conditions have been very bad, but as always you have made
the best of things and have kept up the Grenadier tradition of
invariable cheerfulness under hardships. You are now out for
a short time to reorganise and refit. In a day's time the
Battalion will <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>be as keen and smart as it was before, and
I am confident that that spirit which has carried you through
this attack so well will be as good and keen in any other
operation which you may be called upon to perform in future.</p>

<p>I congratulate all ranks, and I sympathise with you for not
having found more Germans to kill, which would have made up
in some small degree for all the worry and anxiety of the
preliminary preparations.</p>

<p>During the night of the 7th the Battalion moved into some trenches
near Marcoing, and next morning it crossed the St. Quentin Canal at
Masnières. The canal was being shelled at the time, but the Battalion
escaped without any casualties. Orders were now received for the
Battalion to take part in an attack, the first objective being the
La Targette&mdash;Forenville road, and the second the railway running
north-east of Wambaix. In view of the possibility of the enemy being
forced to retire, the instructions were that the leading companies were
to push on in the general direction of Cattenières.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oct. 9.</div>

<p>Zero was 6 o'clock on the morning of October 9, and the assembly area
for the 1st Guards Brigade was on the line of old German trenches,
south-west of Seranvillers. Taking up its position on the left of the
line, the Battalion had the 2nd Battalion Coldstream Guards on its
right, with the 1st Battalion Irish Guards in reserve. In conjunction
with this force, the 2nd Guards Brigade was to advance on the left and
the New Zealand Division on the right, and the boundary between the two
leading battalions was the main road through Seranvillers and Wambaix.</p>

<p>It had been arranged for the barrage to descend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span> on the first
objective, and so the 2nd Battalion Grenadiers and 2nd Battalion
Coldstream were able to start moving slowly forward ten minutes before
zero hour. No. 3 Company of the Battalion, under Captain Cornforth,
was on the right and No. 4 Company, under Lieutenant Palmer, on the
left, while No. 2 Company, under Captain Wilson, was in support, and
No. 1 Company, under Lieutenant Holbech, in reserve. The foremost
companies advanced in waves, and the supports and reserves in artillery
formation, preceded by strong patrols, Captain Wilson's company being
responsible for clearing the village of Seranvillers. Two howitzers,
a field-gun, several machine-guns, and a few prisoners were captured
without any real opposition, and the Battalion pushed on very rapidly
to within a short distance of Cattenières, where the patrols were sent
ahead through the village.</p>

<p>But as soon as they emerged from Cattenières, and came on to the ridge
to the north they were held up by heavy machine-gun fire from the wood
surrounding the factory at Ignies-le-Petit. There was a considerable
stretch of open ground in front of the wood, and progress became very
difficult. Lieutenant Palmer, commanding No. 4 Company, ordered Second
Lieutenant Osborne to try and advance with his platoon on the left in
order to enfilade the enemy in the south-east corner of the wood. A
certain amount of ground was gained by sectional rushes under extremely
heavy machine-gun fire, but the complete lack of "dead" ground made
real success impossible, and Major Walker decided to postpone any
farther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span> move until it could be made under cover of darkness.</p>

<p>A wonderfully gallant piece of work during this part of the fighting
was done by No. 16796 Private Edgar Holmes, and won for him the
Victoria Cross, which unfortunately he did not live to receive. He
was acting as a stretcher-bearer, and calmly and fearlessly went on
with his errands of mercy to the wounded under a withering machine-gun
fire. He succeeded in getting two men in, and, quite regardless of
the intense fire at close range, was attending to a third when he was
himself hit in the stomach. He did not falter for a moment, and, paying
no attention to his own wound, went forward once more to rescue yet
another of the fallen. He had covered thirty yards in the direction of
the enemy when he was hit again, this time fatally.</p>

<p>At 1 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> on October 10 Major Walker brought up the support
and reserve companies, and directed them to attack the wood and factory
at Ignies-le-Petit. They rushed the factory, encountering little
resistance, and then took up a line and dug in on the farther edge
of the wood, beyond the main road. The whole advance was a complete
success, and the casualties of the Battalion were only one man killed
and 12 wounded. Four hours after the attack began, the 1st Battalion
Irish Guards passed through the Battalion, and went in pursuit of the
retreating Germans.</p>

<p>For the week that followed the Battalion was in Brigade Reserve,
and moved slowly forward through Fresnoy Farm, Bévillers, Quiévy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Boussières to St. Hilaire, when it prepared for the forthcoming attack.</p>

<p>This attack was only part of a very extensive movement on the whole of
the Third Army front. The Sixty-first Division was ordered to advance
on the right of the Guards Division, and the Nineteenth Division, under
Major-General Jefferies, on the left. Acting as the leading battalion
on the right of the Guards Division, the 2nd Battalion Grenadier Guards
had the Valenciennes&mdash;Solesmes road as its first objective, and, for
its second, a line about a quarter of a mile west of the villages of
Vertain and Romeries. The capture of Solesmes, which was known to be
full of civilians, and strongly held by the enemy, was entrusted to
the Sixty-first Division, while the Guards Division was to push<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span> right
on to its final objective. This gave the Battalion the delicate and
dangerous task of advancing the whole way with an exposed flank. Two
other features added to the difficulty of the man&#339;uvre. The long
distance to the final objective had to be traversed under cover of
darkness, and before it could reach the outskirts of Solesmes, known as
St. Python, the Battalion had to cross the River Selle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oct. 19.</div>

<p>Leaving St. Hilaire at 9.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> on the 19th inst., the
Battalion followed the 1st Battalion Irish Guards until it reached
its assembly position, which was the railway running from Haussy to
Solesmes. No. 1 Company under Lieutenant Holbech was on the right,
No. 2 Company on the left under Captain Wilson, No. 3 under Captain
Hermon-Hodge in support, and No. 4 under Lieutenant Morgan in reserve.
A drizzling rain fell incessantly, and though the moon was full it was
a very dark night.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oct. 20.</div>

<p>At zero hour, 2 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, under a heavy and very effective
barrage, the Battalion advanced to the river in artillery formation,
guided by tapes. Very indifferent bridges had been erected by the Royal
Engineers and the Pioneer Battalion of the Coldstream Guards, and it
was no easy matter getting all the men across in single file on two
extremely narrow planks. However, there were very few casualties, and
the leading companies deployed into waves, and went forward, followed
by the supports and reserves in artillery formation. Very soon after
the start No. 1 Company got to St. Python, but as it was entering it
came under heavy machine-gun fire from the houses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span> Some useful bombing
work was carried out at this juncture, especially by No. 1 platoon,
led by Corporal Hunter. As the barrage was moving forward, Lieutenant
Holbech decided to leave one platoon to complete the capture of St.
Python, supported by No. 3 Company, while the rest of the leading
companies went on to their first objective, which they reached almost
to schedule time. About 50 prisoners and several machine-guns were
captured in this stage of the attack.</p>

<p>There was an hour's halt at this point, in the course of which the
remaining platoon of No. 1 Company joined up with the leading troops.
It had been uphill work all the way, with a good deal of wire to get
through, and it had been found necessary to constitute No. 3 Company a
defensive flank. Just before another move was due, a party of the enemy
was seen on the right rear of the Battalion, firing lights towards
Solesmes. One platoon under Lieutenant Holbech wheeled about, and
charged it from the rear, "getting home" with the bayonet and capturing
several machine-guns.</p>

<p>The final objective was reached soon after 4 o'clock. But the Germans
were inclined to hold on to their positions, and all the way the
two leading companies met with resistance. This was partly owing to
machine-gun fire from the right flank, as up to this time Solesmes had
not yet been cleared by the Sixty-first Division. On the line of the
final objective No. 1 Company took a field-gun with its garrison of one
officer and 25 men&mdash;which brought the total captures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span> of the Battalion
in the attack up to 200 prisoners, two field-guns, and a large number
of machine-guns and trench mortars.</p>

<p>By daylight the leading companies had consolidated their line of
outposts, and in order to protect the right rear of the Battalion, No.
3 Company dug in in échelon to the right flank, with No. 4 Company in
rear of it. About 9 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> the Sixty-first Division continued
its advance from Solesmes, and came up into line with the Battalion.
Soon after dawn heavy enemy machine-gun fire had been brought to bear
upon the leading companies, and continued for several hours, while the
German artillery, which up to this time had taken little part in the
operations, began to assert itself, and shells of every sort fell round
the battalion. Lieutenant E. M. Neill, who had been conspicuous for his
work and bravery during the advance, was wounded by shell-fire, and the
total casualties were one officer and 52 other ranks. On the evening of
the 22nd the Battalion was relieved by the 24th Royal Fusiliers, and
marched back to St. Vaast, where it "embussed" for Carnières. There it
remained until the end of the month, when it moved on to St. Hilaire,
proceeding the following day to Capelle.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">The 3rd Battalion</h3>

<div class="sidenote">3rd Batt.</div>

<p>In the first week in October the Battalion remained at Doignies,
where during a practice attack a barrage from a smoke rifle grenade
was tried, and on the 8th moved to Premy Chapel. An attack was being
made by the Sixty-second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span> Division, and the Battalion, which was not
called upon, moved on later to Masnières. Cambrai could be seen in the
distance burning fiercely throughout the night.</p>

<p>On the 9th the orders were not received until the Battalion was in its
assembly position.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oct. 9.</div>

<p>In the early part of the attack one of our guns appears to have been
badly laid, with the result that it continued to shoot short, causing
several casualties among the leading companies of the Battalion. This
was particularly irritating, since only a short time before these
companies had been mistaken for the enemy, and had been fired at by
one of our own aeroplanes. The first objective was taken by 6.30, and
no Germans were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span> encountered, the only casualties being caused by our
barrage.</p>

<p>The Battalion started off with No. 1 Company under Captain Fryer on the
right, No. 2 under Captain Adair on the left, No. 3 under Lieutenant
Anson in support, and No. 4 under Captain Bunbury in reserve. As
there seemed every possibility of the Germans retiring rapidly, the
scheme of attack was ambitious, with a large extent of ground to be
covered. The first objective was a trench running from Niergnies to
Seranvillers; the second objective the road running from Cambrai to
La Targette; and after that there were four "bounds," ending up with
the Cambrai&mdash;Beauvois road. There was no sign of the enemy, not even
any hostile shelling at first, and no difficulty was experienced in
securing the objectives. In the second bound, Wambaix Copse, which
might possibly have been held by the enemy, was also taken without
opposition. At 10.30 the capture of Estourmel was effected, and still
the enemy had shown no sign of fighting. Lord Lascelles decided
that the dinners should be eaten now, and as the 1st Guards Brigade
had not come up there was plenty of time for the men to dine before
resuming the advance. It was not until the Battalion reached the
Cambrai&mdash;Beauvois road and Igniel-dit-les-Frisettes that the enemy's
resistance stiffened, and it suffered casualties. Captain Adair with
No. 2 Company occupied Igniel, but reported that casualties were
occurring from machine-gun fire on his right, and from the enemy's
heavy guns at long range. This village was in a clump<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span> of trees on the
crest of a hill on the farther side of the Cambrai&mdash;Beauvois road,
and was approached by a sunken road, on each side of which the ground
rose in a gentle slope, and formed an ideal position for machine-guns.
Captain Adair advanced up the sunken road, and as soon as his company
appeared on the hill it was subjected to a harassing machine-gun fire.
He at first ordered his men to dig themselves in, but later he decided
to move up into Igniel-dit-les-Frisettes. When No. 2 Company moved into
the trees and buildings, it was so heavily shelled that Lord Lascelles,
who had come up to see how the situation was developing, told him his
men would be safer out in the open. There seems little doubt that the
German ammunition was already deteriorating, for when their shells
burst the pieces did not scatter so well as before. But for this the
casualties would certainly have been very heavy, and in all probability
it would have been found necessary to retire from the hill altogether.
At 4.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> Lord Lascelles received instructions to support
a cavalry patrol of the Oxfordshire Hussars, which had been sent out
through the 1st Battalion Coldstream on the left. He was surprised at
this message, for he knew that no cavalry patrol could possibly go out
in the face of this machine-gun fire, and when the officer commanding
the patrol appeared at the Battalion Headquarters to say that it had
been unable to go forward at all, he was able to disregard the order,
and send in a report asking for confirmation of his action. In the
evening orders were received to establish an outpost line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span> with two
companies over the Cambrai&mdash;Beauvois road, with two companies in
support near Estourmel. That night a warning order was received for a
farther advance the next morning, and the Battalion Headquarters moved
up to Grand Chanfemel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oct. 10.</div>

<p>The next morning the 1st Battalion Scots Guards passed through the
outpost line, and continued the advance by bounds, while the Battalion
moved forward in support. No. 3 Company on the right, under Lieutenant
Anson, and No. 4, under Captain Bunbury, formed the support, with the
other two companies in reserve. In the afternoon the Scots Guards were
held up west of St. Hilaire, and were ordered to establish an outpost
line for the night. Nos. 3 and 4 Companies were placed under the orders
of the Officer Commanding the 1st Battalion Scots Guards, while two
companies of the 1st Battalion Coldstream were sent up to take their
place.</p>

<p>On the 11th the 1st Guards Brigade passed through the outpost line, and
continued the advance, while the Battalion went into very comfortable
billets in St. Hilaire, where the German baths were used. On the 13th
the 2nd Guards Brigade passed through with the 3rd Battalion Grenadiers
on the right, the 1st Battalion Coldstream on the left, and the 1st
Battalion Scots Guards in reserve. These Battalions were ordered to be
at immediate notice to move in case the 3rd Guards Brigade, which was
crossing the Selle River, should require assistance, but the warning
orders were later cancelled; and that night the Battalion relieved the
2nd Battalion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span> Scots Guards in the front line along the Selle River.
Second Lieutenant Gunther with a patrol of eight men crossed the river,
and surprised a German whom he gagged and brought back. He reported
that the enemy seemed in a sleepy and disorganised state, and Lord
Lascelles accordingly asked for permission to push a company across the
river that night, but was told instead to establish a bridgehead on the
following night north of St. Python.</p>

<p>The erection of a bridgehead so near to so many houses was a matter
of some difficulty, since it was obvious that the crossing could not
be held if the enemy occupied houses within 300 yards of it. Lord
Lascelles therefore ordered Lieutenant H. I'B. Smith to occupy the
nearest house to the bridgehead and Lieutenant F. Donnison to search
the four or five houses near it and make sure they were empty. Second
Lieutenant Smith had no difficulty in occupying the house, but found
that the walls on the enemy's side were so full of large holes that the
house was untenable. Lieutenant Donnison moved forward to reconnoitre
but ran into the Germans in some force in the streets beyond, and was
forced by machine-gun fire and bombs to fall back on Lieutenant Smith's
party, leaving behind two men who were too badly wounded to move.</p>

<p>The alternatives open to Lord Lascelles were first, to hold the bridge
with trenches dug practically on it, but this was dismissed as being
strategically unsound; secondly, to dig trenches beyond the bridge,
which was difficult, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span> the men would have to be on the top of
the river bank, and overlooked by the houses 300 yards away; thirdly,
to occupy one house and strongly fortify it. This seemed at first to be
the best solution of the difficulty, but when Second Lieutenant Smith
and Second Lieutenant Donnison, who had behaved with great gallantry
and coolness, reported that it was impossible to hold the nearest
house, and that all the neighbouring houses would have to be cleared
of the enemy, Lord Lascelles came to the conclusion that this would
involve him in endless operations in the town. He therefore decided to
have the bridgehead dug in on the banks of the river.</p>

<p>Captain Bunbury, who commanded No. 4 Company, from which the two
platoons had been sent to secure the houses on the farther side of the
river, was placed in a difficult position. He brought up the remainder
of his company, and held a quarter of the village of St. Python, the
houses on the other side of the stream being held entirely by the
Germans. It was impossible to get to him in daylight, and by night all
the streets were swept with machine-gun fire. He handled his men under
circumstances of exceptional difficulty with some skill during the days
he was there. Throughout these operations some five hundred civilians
lived in the cellars and performed many acts of kindness to the men of
the Battalion who visited them. It was impossible for them to move out
of their retreat without being shot at. One little girl, eleven years
old, quite unconscious of the danger she <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>ran, walked out in the
streets in broad daylight, and was brutally shot by a German; at great
risk one of the men of the Battalion went out and carried her back, but
she died.</p>

<p class="p2">This was the beginning of the period when the Germans seemed to spare

from villages.</p>

<p>On the 16th the enemy was reported to be massing men on the St.
Python&mdash;Haussy road, and our artillery shelled the area indicated for
two hours, but no counter-attack developed. The following day the
Battalion was relieved, and went into billets at St. Vaast. On the 20th
the 1st and 3rd Guards Brigades attacked, and captured the high ground
east of Solesmes and St. Python, but the 2nd Guards Brigade was not
wanted. On the 22nd the whole of the Guards Division was taken out of
the line for a week's rest.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>

<p class="center p-left sm">NOVEMBER</p>

<p class="center p-left"><i>Diary of the War</i></p>


<div class="sidenote">Nov. 1918.</div>

<p>The Versailles Conference opened. A mutiny among the German sailors
at Kiel broke out, and had far-reaching effects. In France the Allied
Armies continued to press forward, and the German retreat became more
rapid. In reply to overtures made by the Germans, the Allies replied
that if Germany wished for an armistice she must apply to General
Foch, in the usual military form, for the conditions under which an
armistice would be granted. On the 8th the German Envoys were received
by General Foch, and were given the conditions drawn up by the Allies.
A revolution broke out in Berlin, and the abdication of the Kaiser was
announced. On the 11th the Armistice was signed.</p>

<p>At the beginning of November Austria surrendered unconditionally.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">The Guards Division</h3>

<div class="sidenote">The Guards Division.</div>

<p>The advance in November, culminating in the capture of Maubeuge, was so
rapid, the extent of ground covered in so short a time so great,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span> and
the number of prisoners and guns taken so large, that there was little
doubt that an Armistice on any conditions was the only thing that could
save the German army from absolute disaster.</p>

<p>The Guards Division moved up on the 2nd from Escarmain towards Villers
Pol. The objectives or bounds were no longer measured in yards but in
miles, and the ambitious programme produced by the Divisional Staff
would have been considered beyond the bounds of possibility, even six
months before.</p>

<p>It was known that the Germans must now stand and fight, if they were
to gain time for the withdrawal of their armies elsewhere, and a final
attack was ordered for November 4 in order to break through their
resistance, and complete the victory of the Allied Armies. Preparations
for the attack were somewhat disorganised by a partial withdrawal of
the enemy during the afternoon of the 3rd.</p>

<p>General Sergison-Brooke and General de Crespigny felt their way
forward, and Villers Pol was occupied during the night, but it was
impossible to notify the artillery of the exact position of the leading
companies by the time the attacks started on the 4th, and in order to
allow a margin of safety the barrage had to start some way east of the
village, with the result that some of our troops never caught it. Up to
mid-day the Germans fought very stubbornly, but they were everywhere
driven back, and by the evening Preux-au-Sart was in our hands, an
advance of nearly four miles. So fierce had been the fighting that
the losses on both sides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span> were exceptionally heavy, the Germans in
particular leaving a large number of dead upon the ground.</p>

<p>During the two following days Heywood's Brigade drove back the enemy's
rear-guards another five miles, and patrols of the 1st Battalion
Welsh Guards entered Bavai, an important town, and the junction of no
less than eleven roads. Bavai was not on the front allotted to the
Guards Division, but during the whole of this advance the line on the
left of the Division was very much thrown back, which caused great
inconvenience, since it enabled the enemy to enfilade the troops from
the north, for the Germans were now prodigal in the expenditure of
shells, which they knew they could never carry away with them. The
troops billeted in villages in rear suffered considerably, and as
the left flank of the Division was thrown back the back areas were
all within easy range from the north. In particular the village of
Amfroipret was heavily punished, and General Heywood was severely
wounded by a shell, which exploded in his headquarters just west of
that village. Once more the 3rd Guards Brigade was without a commander.
Brigadier-General Campbell, V.C., was sent for to take command, and in
the meantime the Brigade was commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Stirling,
Scots Guards.</p>

<p>On the 7th Sergison-Brooke's Brigade, passing through the 3rd Guards
Brigade, continued to drive the enemy back, but the following day
the advance was checked owing to enfilade fire from the north. That
afternoon a German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span> orderly carrying an important message was captured.
The message was at once sent by special despatch rider to Divisional
Headquarters, and on being translated proved to be an urgent order
to the rear-guard commander, telling him to hold on to his present
position at all costs, and cover the withdrawal of the main body to a
line east of Maubeuge. The resistance of the rear-guard, the message
added, must be such as to gain time for the consolidation of this new
line and thus save the rest of the army. General Matheson at once
ordered General Sergison-Brooke to push forward his reserve Battalion
(the 3rd Battalion Grenadiers) directly it was dark, with instructions
to force its way through the enemy's rear-guard and straight on down
the road to Maubeuge.</p>

<p>The 3rd Battalion Grenadiers moved forward at 10 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, and
reached the citadel of Maubeuge at 2 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, but it was just
too late to cut off the enemy's rear-guard. De Crespigny's Brigade was
ordered to consolidate a line on the high ground east of the city;
this was many miles east of any point reached by the remainder of the
British Army. With the capture of Maubeuge the advance of the Guards
Division ended, and at 11 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> on the 11th the Armistice was
signed.</p>

<p>The final rapid advance had been made under circumstances of
exceptional difficulty, since the systematic destruction of the
railways by the Germans had necessitated the supply of ammunition and
rations being brought up by road. The country was closely intersected
by streams, and as all road bridges were destroyed, it was neces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>sary
to erect temporary bridges with deviations through the fields leading
to them, while the original bridges were being repaired. Constant rain
and the continuous stream of transport soon turned these deviations
into a quagmire, through which the horses, often up to their bellies in
mud, had to pull their heavy load: only the persistent determination
of the transport officers and men to get through at all hazards, and
the fine condition of the horses made the task of supplying the troops
possible.</p>

<p>Even then these efforts would have been of no avail, but for the work
of the Royal Engineers in repairing the innumerable bridges to carry
lorry traffic: day and night, without rest and with scarcely time for
food, they worked, and never failed to do what was asked of them.</p>

<p>But the finest part of the advance, without which victory could not
have been enforced in 1918, was the dash and courage of the infantry
in face of the insidious knowledge that peace was within sight. Every
officer and man who went into those attacks in November knew that
it might be the last engagement of the war, and that if he avoided
unnecessary risk he would probably get through safely; if he took it,
he might be throwing away his life on the last day of the war. That
knowledge had not the smallest effect upon the conduct of the troops,
and the attack on November 4 was carried out with a dash and reckless
courage that had never been surpassed in the war.</p>

<p>The result cannot be over-estimated: instead of a half-hearted
Armistice with the Germans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span> still under the impression they were,
as far as the army was concerned, virtually the victors, the last
attacks had shown them that it was merely a matter of estimating how
far their defeat had been completed, and had made them understand that
their safest course lay in bringing about an Armistice as speedily as
possible, to save the reputation of their army.</p>

<p>After ten days' rest spent in billets at St. Vaast the Battalion went
in pursuit of the retreating Germans, and marched to Escarmain, which
was being shelled by the enemy. On the 4th the 1st and 2nd Guards
Brigades attacked, while the 3rd Guards Brigade was in Divisional
Reserve. The Battalion moved by companies at 200-yards intervals to
Mortre Farm, where it bivouacked in the orchard, moving on again in the
afternoon to Villers Pol. Here orders were received that the Battalion
was to go through the 3rd Battalion Grenadier Guards and to continue
the advance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nov. 5.</div>

<p>At 2.15 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> the Battalion moved out from Villers Pol with
intervals of thirty yards between platoons, and marched to La Buvette
cross-roads, where a halt was made, and the Lewis guns were taken
off the limbers. Directed by two guides from the 1st Battalion Scots
Guards, the Battalion made its way across country to a bridge, where
a long halt was made to find the Headquarters of the 3rd Battalion
Grenadiers&mdash;no easy matter in the dark. The Battalion eventually
managed to get into position close behind the front line posts. No.
2 Company, under Lieutenant Kennaway, was on the right and in touch
with the 2/20th London Regiment from the Sixty-second Division; No. 3
Company, under Lieutenant Challands, on the left in touch with the 2nd
Battalion Scots Guards; No. 4 Company, under Lieutenant Freeman-Greene,
was in support; and the King's Company, under Captain Spence, was in
reserve.</p>

<p>At 6 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> the advance began. Rain fell and continued
intermittently during the three days' operations. The advance was much
hampered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span> especially in the initial stages, by a creeping barrage
put down by the Sixty-second Division, without any warning having
been given to the Battalion. The going was very heavy, and the very
enclosed country, intersected by thick hedges and wire fences, made it
difficult for the companies to keep their directions. Little opposition
was encountered, until the leading platoons reached Amfroipret, when
one German officer and five men were taken prisoners in the village.
Immediately east of the village and in the wooded country south of the
railway, the Battalion began to encounter the enemy's rear-guard, but
after driving it in some way the advance came to a standstill about the
line of the road from Bout la Haut to Cambron Farm. The extraordinary
difficulty of locating a hidden enemy in such an enclosed country made
the advance hazardous, and the Germans appeared to be holding very
strongly with machine-guns a line some five hundred yards east of this
road. Lieutenant Kennaway, with No. 2 Company, attempted to secure the
cross-roads in front of him, and failed to make any headway against the
enemy's machine-guns. During this gallant attempt Lieutenant Lamont,
who was with the leading platoon, was killed, in addition to many men.</p>

<p>The situation was not without anxiety, for on neither flank could any
British troops be seen. It looked as if the Battalion had been going
on too fast for the rest of the line, and Lieutenant-Colonel Bailey
decided to wait until the situation on the right developed. No. 2
Company accord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>ingly dug in where it was, and the King's Company was
moved to Cambron Farm to fill up the gap there was between the right
of the line and the Sixty-second Division. The situation on the left
required some adjustment, for the 2nd Battalion Scots Guards had been
apparently held up, and No. 3 Company had to be responsible for that
flank of the Battalion. About mid-day a company of the Scots Guards
came up through the village, and occupied Bermeries without opposition,
making the left flank once more secure. This enabled No. 4 Company
to push forward through the orchards and drive out an enemy's post,
but again the enemy's machine-guns prevented any farther advance. The
difficulties in this action were that, when once a company or platoon
had been sent off anywhere, it could not be found again owing to the
enclosed nature of the country. No communication between the various
parties was possible, and the operations therefore developed into small
isolated parties fighting independently of each other. The Germans
began to shell the village with heavy shell during the afternoon, and
the front line posts were fired on at close range by field artillery.
During the evening No. 3 Company took over the outpost line from No.
4 Company, which was withdrawn to cellars in the eastern end of the
village.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Bailey received orders for a farther advance next day,
and the King's and No. 2 Companies were to secure the cross-roads, if
possible during the night. It was, however, so dark, and the enemy was
in so great strength,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span> that the operation was not attempted that night.
Brigadier-General Heywood, commanding the 3rd Guards Brigade, was
wounded in the evening, and the command devolved upon Lieut.-Colonel
Stirling, commanding the 2nd Scots Guards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nov. 6.</div>

<p>It poured with rain all night. The Battalion formed up south of the
railway on the line of the forward posts, with the King's Company,
under Captain Spence, on the right; No. 4 Company, under Lieutenant
Freeman-Greene, on the left; No. 3 Company, under Lieutenant Challands,
in support (their position north of the railway being taken over by
the Welsh Guards), and No. 2 Company, under Lieutenant Kennaway, in
reserve. The King's Company and No. 2 Company were ordered to make good
the line of the Bavai&mdash;Queve-au-loup road, where Nos. 2 and 3 Companies
would advance through them, and secure the last two objectives. The
King's and No. 4 Companies were comparatively fresh, as they had had
some hours' rest in barns and cellars during the night, but Nos. 2
and 3 Companies were soaked through by the rain, and tired out after
a hard day constantly on the move and a night spent in digging in on
the outpost line. At 6 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> the advance began, and was again
most difficult, on account of the enclosed country. The Battalion met
no opposition until it reached some high ground, when the leading
platoons came under a very heavy machine-gun fire from the far side
of the valley, and a harassing fire from field-guns. No. 4 Company
was temporarily checked, but the King's Company, under cover of the
houses and hedges along the Mecquignies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span> road, seized the crossing over
the river, and worked up till it got in touch with a company from the
Sixty-second Division on the right. This advance through houses was
well carried out, and the Lewis gunners performed wonders in getting
their guns into houses. One party of German machine-gunners was shot
down in the church tower. No. 3 Company was halted on the road, and
No. 2 Company in reserve moved up to the cross-roads at Bavisiaux. The
grounds of Mecquignies Château were strongly held by machine-guns,
but after a sharp fight the King's Company drove out the enemy and
seized the Château. In this fighting Second Lieutenant A. D. Anderson
was killed, while gallantly leading his men to the attack. Lieutenant
Freeman-Greene, seeing the King's Company advance up the farther slope,
at once began to push on with No. 4 Company, and in spite of a hail of
machine-gun bullets reached the line of the river with little loss,
and gained touch with the left of the King's Company. After this the
fighting became very promiscuous, and platoons became scattered among
the orchards and fields of the Château. Touch was established with the
Welsh Guards, who had been temporarily checked in Buvigny, and who were
now moving on, and the enemy seemed to be retiring all along the line.
Lieut.-Colonel Bailey was ordered to push on and try and seize the
line on the Bavai road before night, and he accordingly moved up No. 2
Company to the Château grounds. The King's and No. 4 Companies had in
the meantime made good the high ground north of the Château,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span> driving
out some advanced posts of the enemy. No. 3 Company was ordered to move
through Mecquignies village and to seize the orchards north-east of the
village. This it succeeded in doing, meeting with little opposition.
The King's and No. 4 Companies at once prolonged the line to the left,
and pushed out patrols to the east. This line was consolidated, and as
the night was very dark no farther advance was considered advisable.</p>

<p>The 466th German Regiment which opposed the advance fought extremely
well, and was cleverly handled by its commander, who thoroughly
understood how to fight a rear-guard action. The wet weather and the
mud made these operations peculiarly trying to men who had had little
training in close country fighting, but the discipline in the Battalion
was so good that each platoon, however isolated, could be relied on
to act intelligently. The scenes in the various villages were most
touching, for the civilians who emerged from cellars and underground
dug-outs all acclaimed the men as their deliverers, and were highly
excited in their joy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nov. 7.</div>

<p>Early on the 7th the 1st Battalion Scots Guards advanced through the
Battalion, which was withdrawn to Amfroipret. Lieut.-Colonel Bailey
issued the following message to the Company Commanders:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Please let all ranks know that I consider the advance on the
5th and 6th to have been carried out excellently in spite of
very heavy going and the difficulties of keeping direction.
On the 5th Nos. 2 and 3 Companies, though they had little
fighting, had a thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span> miserable and uncomfortable time,
which as usual was borne with the greatest cheerfulness. The
King's Company and No. 4 Company were better off, as they got
a few hours' rest under cover.</p>

<p>On the 6th, in spite of very heavy machine-gun fire from front
and flank and most difficult country, the King's Company and
No. 4 pushed ahead and drove in the rear troops of the enemy,
thus making good the passage of the river Du Moulin de Bavai.
The greatest credit is due not only to the fine fighting
powers of the men but also to the good leading and forethought
of the leaders.</p>

<p>The two days' fighting were unsatisfactory as far as the
killing of Germans was concerned, and the conditions miserable
from the start to finish, but the Battalion, as always, went
quicker and farther than any other Battalion in the Brigade,
and the distance you went undoubtedly helped the 24th Division
by threatening the communications of the enemy, holding the
ground north-west of Bavai, and causing them to retire.
You have well kept up the traditions of the Regiment and
maintained the Grenadier spirit&mdash;the most magnificent in the
world. I congratulate officers, non-commissioned officers, and
men, and I know that you will never fail.</p>

<p class="r2"><span class="smcap">W. R. Bailey</span>, Lieut.-Colonel,</p>

<p class="right">Commanding 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 9th the Battalion marched to La Longueville, and the 1st Guards
Brigade entered Maubeuge. On the following day it reached Douzies,
where the news arrived that the Armistice had been signed. On the
morning of the 11th the Battalion paraded, and the Commanding Officer
read out the official telegram declaring the Armistice to be in force.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nov. 4.</div>

<p>The Battalion marched from Capelle through La Croisette and Villers
Pol to its assembly area, which was a line 100 yards east of the
Jenlain&mdash;Le Quesnoy road. Villers Pol was being heavily shelled at
the time, and a good number of casualties resulted. Lieut.-Colonel
Walker was ordered to advance in support of the 2nd Battalion
Coldstream Guards, until the capture of the first objective, the
Fresnay&mdash;Wargnies-le-Petit road, had been completed, then to pass
through and secure the second objective, a line some 3000 yards farther
east. Zero hour was fixed for 7.20 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> The rain ceased early,
but a very heavy mist hung low over the ground and made it impossible
for troops to see more than 200 yards ahead. No. 4 Company, under
Lieutenant Cubitt, was on the left of the line; No. 3 Company, under
Lieutenant Palmer, on the right; No. 2 Company, under Lieutenant Dent,
in support;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span> and No. 1 Company, under Captain Hermon-Hodge, in reserve.</p>

<p>The 2nd Guards Brigade under Brigadier-General Sergison-Brooke went
forward on the right of the Battalion. Owing to mist the Coldstream
lost their direction, and proceeded at a right incline. Seeing troops
ahead moving along close to the barrage, the foremost companies of the
Battalion imagined that they were Coldstream Guards making for the
first objective. It was only discovered later that these were really
the Germans in retirement. As No. 4 Company passed over the high ground
near the wood south-west of Wargnies-le-Petit, the mist suddenly
lifted, and they came under heavy machine-gun fire from the north.
Lieutenant Cubitt was wounded, and the company had a considerable
number of casualties. Second Lieutenant Osborne, who now took command,
led two platoons a bit farther by short rushes, but was eventually
stopped by a sweeping machine-gun fire, which made farther progress
impossible. German field-guns were also firing at a short range, and
the Battalion lost a good many men. Lieutenant Osborne therefore took
it upon himself to make a personal reconnaissance of the enemy's
positions, and see whether there was not a better line of advance.
With almost reckless gallantry he went out, and carefully examined the
German line, but the result of his scrutiny was never known, as he was
shot through the heart by a machine-gun bullet on the way back. As No.
4 Company was now without an officer, Sergeant E. Carter took command.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Nov. 5.</div>

<p>Meanwhile No. 3 Company under Lieutenant Palmer had made its way
through the southern part of the wood near Wargnies-le-Petit. On
leaving the wood along the eastern edge, they came under machine-gun
and rifle fire from the enemy, who was barely 200 yards away.
Lieutenant Palmer advanced by short rushes, and not only took the
position, but captured or killed the whole garrison. It was found
impossible to proceed, and the company dug in a line of outposts.
During this attack the field-guns of the Guards Divisional Artillery
were brought up at a gallop to within a very short distance behind
the leading troops&mdash;a daring and difficult achievement that is worthy
of record. As soon as these guns opened fire on the village of
Wargnies-le-Petit, the companies on the left were able to continue
their progress. Touch was then gained with the 3rd Grenadier Guards
on the right, and with the Forty-second Division on the left. Nothing
more could be done that afternoon, and the Battalion consolidated its
position. Early on the morning of the 5th the 1st Battalion Irish
Guards passed through, and pursued the retreating Germans, who had
fallen back during the night. The Battalion moved up into billets in
Wargnies-le-Petit, and reorganised. Owing to casualties among officers
and men, Nos. 3 and 4 Companies were amalgamated into a composite
company under Lieutenant Palmer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nov. 7.</div>

<p>Two days later the Battalion moved on to Bavai. On the 9th it was in
Brigade Reserve, and supported the 2nd Guards Brigade in the advance on
Maubeuge. No. 1 Company was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span> in support of the 2nd Battalion Coldstream
Guards, and No. 2 Company in support of the 1st Battalion Irish Guards,
taking the main Bavai&mdash;Maubeuge road as the centre of the Brigade
frontage. The composite company followed in support, ready to form a
defensive flank in either direction. There was no opposition, and at
5.30 the Battalion entered Douzies, and occupied the high ground east
of Maubeuge. The 2nd Battalion Coldstream Guards consolidated the
outpost line, with No. 1 Company forming a Brigade defensive flank. The
remainder of the Battalion was billeted at Port Allont. On entering
Maubeuge the troops had a great reception from the civilians in the
town.</p>

<p>On the 11th the cryptic news arrived:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Hostilities will cease at 11 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> to-day.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Battalion moved off early to bivouac at Capelle. After slipping
and stumbling along a greasy chalk track, the companies reached their
positions, and were told to dig in. This order was easier to give than
to execute, for the men had only their light entrenching tools, which
were ill suited for excavating a flinty chalk ground. A few shells came
over to enliven the proceedings, but otherwise the day passed quietly.
On the following day orders were received for an attack by the Guards
Division, and battle stores were drawn.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nov. 4.</div>

<p>On the 4th the Battalion started to take up its assembly positions in
rear of La Flaque Wood, and was much hampered on the approach march
by the crowded state of the roads and the congestion of traffic. On
reaching Villers Pol, it was forced to halt, as the bridge across
the Rhonelle had been destroyed, and the stream had to be crossed
by a single plank. During the crossing a few high-explosive and gas
shells were sent over, and the men had to put on their masks. Owing to
the dense fog the Company Commanders experienced some difficulty in
finding the way to the assembly positions, but fortunately they had
been provided with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span> large-scale aeroplane reconnaissance maps, and
were able to go unerringly by the shortest route. The attack was led
by the 1st Battalion Coldstream, which had the 1st Guards Brigade (2nd
Battalion Coldstream) on their left. The Battalion was to pass through
the 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards, whilst the 2nd Battalion Grenadier
Guards was to pass similarly through the 2nd Battalion Coldstream
Guards, and to continue the attack across a gully and on to the
villages and woods beyond. On the way No. 2 Company had some casualties
from shell-fire.</p>

<p>Though somewhat late on account of the fog, the Battalion started off
with No. 1 Company (under Lieutenant Campbell) on the right, and No.
2 Company (under Captain Adair) on the left, and advanced through
Flaque Wood. Passing through the leading Battalions they found the
2nd Battalion Coldstream had occupied the frontage of the 2nd Guards
Brigade, and throughout the day (as indeed throughout the whole
advance) units were apt to incline to the right, owing to the fact that
the enemy retirement was north-east, and the enemy units gave way more
readily opposite our right flank.</p>

<p>Lord Lascelles had issued orders that he would move Battalion
Headquarters to a sunken road, on the edge of the gully, two hours
after the leading companies were timed to pass that spot. The approach
of this road was shelled by a field-gun at short range, but fortunately
the arable ground, on which the shells fell, was so soft that one
of them bursting in the middle of Battalion Headquarters caused no
casualties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>On arriving at the road, the leading companies did not advance beyond
it, but at this moment the enemy were seen removing their gun, and a
patrol from each company was hurried forward, down the gully, whilst
Lewis guns were set to fire over their heads at the retiring gun.</p>

<p>On the far side of the gully an abandoned 5·9 was taken over by No.
1 Company, and on reaching the crest of the hill an enemy trench was
found defended by machine-guns. Whilst reconnoitring to organise his
attack, Captain Adair was wounded in the leg.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the Sixty-second Division (on the right) had got well
forward, and the right of No. 1 Company was able to push on whilst the
left of No. 1 Company and the whole of No. 2 Company were held up.
Second Lieutenant A. E. F. F. Strangways-Rogers, reconnoitring along
the hedgerows on the right of No. 2 Company, was fatally wounded.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Campbell then organised an attack with his right platoon,
under a barrage of smoke-bombs, which, though they were badly handled
and burst innocuously in the air, so astonished the enemy that he
abandoned the key to his position, and withdrew down his trench to a
position in rear.</p>

<p>Farther on were some thick-set hedges, admirably adapted for a
rear-guard action, and on reaching them Lieutenant Carstairs found
there was only one gap sufficiently large to let one man through at a
time. He led the way, followed by his platoon, and immediately came
under fire from the left flank. While<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span> trying to locate the enemy, he
was severely wounded, and as there were no stretcher-bearers available
he had to lie where he was. Lieutenant Campbell on hearing this came
up, and seeing that the men were lying bunched up together, ordered
Lieutenant Gunther to straighten out the line, while he went to get a
platoon to reinforce his right flank. The Germans were unpleasantly
close, but their exact position had not yet been located. Lieutenant
Gunther, having carried out his orders, went out to where Lieutenant
Carstairs was lying on the ground, and was shot through the head.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the left of No. 2 Company was not in touch with the 2nd
Battalion Grenadier Guards, and the enemy was trying to creep round
that flank into the gully. Fortunately Lieut.-Colonel R. Bingham with a
section of the Guards Machine Gun Regiment was there, and had managed
by skilful sniping to hold them back. Lord Lascelles decided to bring
up No. 3 Company under Captain de Geijer to protect that flank, and
ordered the two leading companies to take advantage of the delay to eat
their rations.</p>

<p>During this delay the enemy opposite No. 2 Company, finding their
southern flank had been driven in, retired off the hill, and evacuated
the greater part of the village of Preux, which lay below. As soon as
his flank was secure, Captain Adair sent a platoon, under Lieutenant
Fairbairn, forward, and this platoon occupied the northern end of the
village without resistance. In No. 4 Company Lieutenant Godman was
wounded.</p>

<p>The enemy still held a trench in front of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span> southern end of the
village, but an attack launched by Lieutenant Campbell drove them out
of a position, which was really untenable when the houses in their rear
were held by us. They abandoned their machine-guns and their equipment.</p>

<p>There remained only a few detached houses at the southern end of the
village, with a trench in front of them, to complete the capture of the
line east of Preux, from which the following day's attack was to start.
This position was approached down an open slope, and the attacking
party was driven back, Lieutenant Campbell (the only officer left in
No. 1 Company), Sergeant Bennett, Sergeant Stevenson, and Sergeant
Valerio being wounded.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Campbell remained with his company, and organised a fresh
attack to take place at dusk, but left the execution of it to Company
Sergeant-Major Marks, who carried it out with great skill and resource.
He captured the trench but not the houses, and consolidated his
position.</p>

<p>Lord Lascelles ordered the attack on the houses to be postponed until
10 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, when it would be dark. This was accomplished without
difficulty, and the jumping-off line for the next day's attack was
completed. During the night Lieutenant F. Anson was sent to take
command of No. 1 Company.</p>

<p>The casualties among stretcher-bearers had been particularly heavy,
but Captain S. Phillimore did the work of four men in attending to the
wounded and relieving the medical officer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span> of some of his work, which
owing to the shortage of stretcher-bearers was scattered all over the
field.</p>

<p>Captain Adair and Lieutenant Campbell were afterwards specially
mentioned by the Commanding Officer in his report of the operations,
not only on account of the skill and courage they displayed in handling
their companies, but also for their tenacity and courage in carrying on
their duties for some hours after they were wounded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nov. 5.</div>

<p>On the 5th the 3rd Guards Brigade passed through, and continued the
advance, while the Battalion remained behind at Preux, and was employed
on salvage work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nov. 7.</div>

<p>On the 7th the Battalion was placed, at the last moment, on the left
of the attack, but, owing to the state of the roads, it did not reach
the line from which it was to start for the attack, until twenty
minutes after the other Battalions had started. The enemy had, however,
retired, and the objectives were occupied without opposition. Since
the area allotted to the Battalion was in the Twenty-fourth Divisional
Area, the Battalion was relieved by the 9th Battalion East Surrey
Regiment, and went into support to the 2nd Guards Brigade at Audignies.</p>

<p>On the 8th the 2nd Guards Brigade was again ordered to continue the
attack. The Battalion, being in support, moved off at 6 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>,
but was forced to halt west of Longueville, where the bridge had been
demolished. After a bridge had been constructed by the Battalion the
limbers were pushed across at once, and the companies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span> crossed without
difficulty. Billets in Malgarni were taken, until the news arrived that
no farther move forward was likely that day, when the Battalion moved
up north into Longueville. From despatches captured from the Germans
it was known that a general retirement had been ordered that night,
and the Brigadier asked Lord Lascelles whether his Battalion was fresh
enough to attempt the capture of Maubeuge that night. He answered
that it was, and the Battalion was ordered to advance along the main
Maubeuge road. It was a very dark night; and a straight high road,
often above the level of the surrounding fields, where the enemy might
still be lurking, was not the best route to take, but as rapidity was
the main point, Lord Lascelles moved the Battalion in advance-guard
formation straight down the road, instructing the companies to occupy
the ditches on either side of the road if attacked.</p>

<p>Although hampered by mine craters, the Battalion reached Maubeuge at 4
<span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, and occupied the town and citadel. It met no opposition,
but three German officers and 35 men were taken prisoners. So rapid was
our advance that Lieutenant Bunbury sent a platoon to capture a German
field-gun still in action. This platoon got within 150 yards of the gun
before it was taken away at a gallop. The only civilian Lord Lascelles
was able to find above ground in Maubeuge was a priest, who told him
that the enemy had all retired a few hours before the Grenadiers
arrived, which confirmed the information extracted from the German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
despatches. The inhabitants came out in the morning, and welcomed the
Battalion with the greatest enthusiasm.</p>

<p>On the 11th the cessation of hostilities was announced, and the
Battalion attended a thanksgiving service.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>

<p class="center p-left sm">THE MARCH OF THE GUARDS DIVISION INTO GERMANY, AND THE RETURN HOME</p>


<div class="sidenote">The Guards Division 1918.</div>

<p>After an impressive thanksgiving service at Maubeuge, the march into
Germany began, and the Guards Division moved by stages to Cologne.
The weather broke, and on several days the men were soaked before
they reached their billets in the evening. At first the advent of the
British troops was hailed with enthusiasm by the inhabitants of the
towns and villages, and the people on whom the men were billeted vied
with each other to make things as comfortable as possible for their
visitors. Flowers were thrown at the men, speeches were made, and
cheering crowds of peasants greeted the Battalions as they arrived, but
as the march continued, and they reached the Flemish part of Belgium
this good feeling changed to one of apathy, bordering at times on
incivility. The people of this district had been untouched by the war,
and regarded the mass of troops who swarmed into their houses as an
intolerable affliction.</p>

<p>When the British troops arrived at the frontier of Germany, they
supposed that the march would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span> be continued through a hostile
population, but so far was this from the truth, that the people of
Germany cringed before the British soldier, and seemed only surprised
at the considerate manner in which they were being treated. Whether the
Germans expected to be as brutally treated as the Belgians had been
by their own soldiers, or whether they were under the impression that
their conduct would in some way affect the peace terms it is difficult
to say; but the fact remains that the British troops received nothing
but kindness at the hands of the inhabitants. In some of the towns that
were passed through, the inhabitants did not appear to grasp the fact
that they belonged to a conquered nation, and that the best they could
do was to remove their hats respectfully, as the Commanding Officers
rode past at the head of their Battalions, but the escorts had much
pleasure in teaching them manners, by knocking off their hats and caps
as they passed.</p>

<p>The routes taken by the four Battalions were as follows:</p>

<p>Cologne, it was feared, might be difficult to manage, for, although
the country people had submissively borne the mass of British troops
inflicted upon them, it seemed probable that the inhabitants of a large
town like Cologne would resent the occupation. The disorderly elements
might take advantage of the arrival of troops, belonging to their most
hated enemy, to make a hostile demonstration, and even to shoot. But
here again a surprise awaited our men, for the greater portion of the
inhabitants hailed the Battalions, as the only means of escape from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
anarchy. The British military authorities found that the population
readily submitted to the most stringent measures, that were considered
necessary for the maintenance of order.</p>

<p>The life at Cologne was on the whole pleasant, but after a short time
monotonous. After the novelty of playing the part of conquerors in a
German town had worn off, the men naturally wished to go home. The
only event that is worth chronicling was the arrival of the colours
of each Battalion in January. Colour parties consisting of picked
officers and N.C.O.'s were despatched to London to bring them out:
in the 1st Battalion Lieutenant J. A. Lloyd and Second Lieutenant M.
G. Farquharson, M.C.; in the 2nd Battalion Lieutenant W. H. S. Dent,
M.C., and Lieutenant L. Holbech, D.S.O., M.C.; and in the 3rd Battalion
Lieutenant K. A. Campbell, D.S.O., and Second Lieutenant E. L. F.
Clough-Taylor.</p>

<p>The 4th Battalion, having been specially raised during the war, had
no colours, and was presented with a Union Colour by Major H.R.H. The
Prince of Wales. The ceremony took place on the 14th of January, and in
presenting the colour His Royal Highness said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Colonel Pilcher, Officers, Warrant Officers, Non-Commissioned
Officers, and Men of the 4th Battalion Grenadier Guards&mdash;The
King, the Colonel-in-Chief of the Regiment, has commanded me
to entrust to your safe-keeping this colour which His Majesty
has presented to you in recognition of your gallantry. Less
than three months after your formation you were fighting at
Loos. At once you showed how completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span> you had absorbed
the great traditions of the First or Grenadier Regiment of
Foot Guards. You added fresh laurels to your record in the
great attacks of the Guards Division in the battle of the
Somme in September 1916. In the advance on Passchendaele in
1917, and later in the year at Cambrai, you still further
enhanced your fighting reputation. Your historic stand in
front of Hazebrouck in April last year earned your Battalion
its second V.C., and was largely responsible for checking the
enemy's advance. It is a special pleasure to me to hand you
this colour in the hour of victory, having like yourselves
the honour of serving in this our great regiment. May it be
a perpetual reminder to you of the honour you have won for
yourselves and for the whole regiment in this war.</p></blockquote>

<p>Colonel Pilcher replied as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Your Royal Highness&mdash;On behalf of the Officers, Warrant
Officers, Non-Commissioned Officers, and Men of the 4th
Battalion Grenadier Guards, I beg to thank you for the
generous words you have addressed to the Battalion under my
command in presenting this colour, the gift of His Majesty,
the Colonel-in-Chief of the Regiment.</p>

<p>This gracious mark of His Majesty's recognition of the
services of the Battalion during the war is most deeply
appreciated by all ranks who are in Your Royal Highness's
presence amongst us here to-day on enemy soil&mdash;a memorable
symbol of the completeness of the victory of our arms.</p>

<p>In thanking Your Royal Highness for coming here to-day, may I
request you to beg His Majesty the King, the Colonel-in-Chief
of the Regiment, to accept the grateful and loyal thanks of
the 4th Battalion Grenadier Guards.</p></blockquote>

<p>In February orders for the Guards Division to return home were
received, and one by one the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span> Battalions went to Dunkirk, where they
embarked for England. The 2nd Battalion was the first to reach London,
and its reception by the crowd, assembled to welcome the men home, was
most enthusiastic.</p>

<p>On March 22 all the Battalions had a great ovation when they marched
past the King at Buckingham Palace, and afterwards went on to the
Mansion House. Though it was a bitterly cold day, thousands of people
thronged the streets, and filled the windows and house-tops to cheer
the men as they passed. Demobilised officers and men in plain clothes
followed their battalions, and all the wounded who were able to march
joined the procession, while lorries were provided for those who had
lost a leg or who were too badly wounded to march. Even the blind
joined in, and marched with men to guide them. The Household Cavalry
came first, and were followed by the Battalions of the Guards Division,
headed by Lieut.-General the Earl of Cavan and his Staff. Amongst them
rode the Prince of Wales, who was greeted with the greatest enthusiasm
as he passed. Major-General Feilding and his Staff also rode past,
in addition to many Brigadier-Generals, who had commanded one of
the Guards Brigades, while officers, who had been in command of the
Battalion at any period during the war, rode alongside the officer
actually in command.</p>

<p>Representatives of the Artillery with guns, the Engineers with
pontoons, the Army Medical Corps, and Army Service Corps, who had
been attached to the Guards Division in France, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span> took part in the
procession. In the City the crowds were, if possible, denser and more
enthusiastic than in the West End, and the scene at the Guildhall
was a sight that no one will forget. After marching through the City
the procession returned to the West End, and some battalions went to
barracks, while others, not quartered in London, proceeded to the
railway station.</p>

<p>After the march every man was handed the following message from the
King, bearing a facsimile of His Majesty's signature:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="smcap r1">Buckingham Palace.</p>

<p>Officers, Non-Commissioned Officers, and Men of the Guards
Division&mdash;It is with pride and satisfaction that I take the
Salute of the Guards Division on this memorable occasion
of their triumphal march through London, and on the same
spot where Queen Victoria in July 1856 welcomed back three
battalions of Guards from the Crimea.</p>

<p>The Guards Division, first formed in 1915, practically served
in every sector in the Western Front, and my visits to the
British Armies in the field gave me opportunities of seeing
the battle grounds on which it has made so great and enduring
a name.</p>

<p>The Division, which commenced its brilliant career at Loos,
took a prominent part in 1916 in the hard fighting on the
Somme, when on two occasions three Battalions of the same
regiment were in the line together.</p>

<p>At the third battle of Ypres the Division responded to the
call of its Commander by capturing all allotted objectives in
three separate attacks.</p>

<p>The fighting round Cambrai, and the historical counter-attack
which broke up a dangerous German thrust at Gouzeaucourt, will
ever be remembered.</p>

<p>During the critical days of 1918 an heroic resistance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span> was
offered to the vigorous assaults of an enemy numerically
stronger and elated by success, while during our subsequent
rapid advance the efforts of the Division were crowned by the
capture of Maubeuge, the flag of which is carried on parade
to-day, a grateful tribute from its citizens.</p>

<p>Nor do I forget the other Arms which enabled the three
Brigades of Guards for the first time in the history of the
British Army to fight as a Division. The Guards Division Royal
Artillery, composed of the 74th and 75th Brigades of Field
Artillery; the Guards Division Royal Engineers, formed of
the 55th, 75th, and 76th Field Companies; the 3rd, 4th, and
9th Field Ambulances, constituting the Guards Division Field
Ambulance, and the Guards Division Train and Supply Column.</p>

<p>All these, inspired by the best traditions of their respective
regiments and corps, fostered the invincible spirit and dogged
determination of a Division which knew no defeat.</p>

<p>Now, after three and a half years of close co-operation in the
field, through the ever-changing fortunes of war, the units of
the Guards Division are about to separate.</p>

<p>As your Colonel-in-Chief I wish to thank you one and all for
faithful and devoted services, and to bid you God-speed. May
you ever retain the same mutual feelings of true comradeship
which animated and ennobled the life of the Guards Division.</p>

<p class="r1">(Signed)&emsp;&emsp;GEORGE R.I.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 22, 1919.</p></blockquote>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>

<p class="center p-left sm">THE 7TH (GUARDS) ENTRENCHING BATTALION</p>


<div class="sidenote">Entrenching Battalion. 1915-18.</div>

<p>The enormous amount of spade work, required for the long and intricate
network of trenches, rendered some measures necessary for supplementing
the work, usually done by the fighting forces; and thus entrenching
battalions were formed, composed of drafts for the front, awaiting
absorption in their respective units; but the system of detaching
men from Battalions of Guards and sending them to fill any vacancies
that might occur in one of the entrenching battalions was not at all
satisfactory. In the first place, to allow men on arrival in France at
once to go to an entrenching battalion, where the discipline was more
lax, and the habits and customs different from those which obtained
in the regiments of Guards was a measure hardly calculated to improve
them as fighting men. And in the second place, it was contrary to the
regulations for men of the Guards to be commanded by any but their own
officers.</p>

     <p class="p0 center p-left"><i>Brigadier-General A.F.A.N. Thorne, D.S.O.</i></p>
  </div>

<p class="p2">The idea of forming a Guards Entrenching Battalion seems to have come
from certain <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>officers at the base. Shortly before the arrival of the
new battalions of the Guards in France, rumours were afloat that an
entrenching battalion for the Guards Division was about to be formed.
Captain Viscount Lascelles wrote a letter to the effect that a platoon
from the reinforcements of every battalion of Guards was to be diverted
to an entrenching battalion. The platoon from the 2nd Battalion
Grenadiers had already been told off, and was to be commanded by an
officer of the Connaught Rangers, while the Battalion itself was to be
placed under a cavalry captain. Captain Viscount Lascelles deplored
the fact that there was no one of sufficient seniority at the base, to
combat these proposals, and thought the whole matter should be referred
to the Lieutenant-Colonel rather than let it lapse, on the judgment of
half a dozen ensigns at the base.</p>

<p>Nothing, however, appears to have been done until November, when a
Guards Entrenching Battalion was formed, and Major E. C. Ellice,
Grenadier Guards, was sent out to take command. He arrived at Chipilly
on the Somme, about five miles from Bray, on December 1, 1915, and took
over the Battalion from Major Clutterbuck, who had been temporarily in
command. The Battalion consisted of 230 Grenadiers, 300 Coldstream, 250
Scots Guards, and 200 Irish Guards, with 40 tunnellers from the Royal
Engineers.</p>

<p>Major Ellice, having made the acquaintance of his new Battalion,
appointed Lieutenant Ian Bullough, Coldstream Guards, to be Adjutant,
while Captain Jones, who had hitherto occupied that post, became
Quartermaster. The Battalion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span> was divided up into four companies: No.
1 Company Grenadiers under Captain M. Lloyd, No. 2 Coldstream under
Lieutenant Viand, No. 3 Scots Guards under Lieutenant Maitland, and
No. 4 Irish Guards under Lieutenant Hanbury. The billets in which the
men lived were not only uncomfortable but also extremely inconvenient,
being sometimes over a mile apart, and so cramped were the men for room
that pigsties even were made use of to house them: it was therefore
with pleasure that Major Ellice received instructions to move the
men to Wood Camp, which was no paradise, but still preferable to the
pigsties, and much nearer the trenches. An old stone quarry, worked by
a gang of twelve quarry-men under a Lieutenant in the Royal Engineers,
provided the material for draining the camp and improving the roads.
Water carts were obtained to provide sufficient water for cooking
parties, and fatigue parties were sent every evening to draw water for
other purposes from the Somme.</p>

<p>The great advantage of an entrenching battalion was quickly seen by the
rest of the Army, since the battalions that came out of the front line
were relieved of working during their rest. It had formerly been the
custom for resting battalions to dig reserve lines, but now this duty
was taken over by the entrenching battalion. All reserve trenches were
made by it; emplacements for field-guns, howitzers, and machine-guns
constructed, brushwood cut for revetting, roads repaired, carrying
parties for all materials necessary for trench warfare supplied.</p>

<p>The staff of the Battalion was kept as per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>manent as possible, but the
Battalion itself was used as a stepping-stone from the base battalion
to the Battalions in the front line. The training the officers received
was invaluable, as it accustomed them to shell-fire. One or two shells
invariably fell near the working-parties; sometimes as many as thirty
to forty shells would explode in the neighbourhood. This showed the
officers that the effect was local, unless the shell happened to strike
a hard surface. It gave them confidence, and they gradually became used
to unaimed shell-fire.</p>

<p>At the end of December 1915 Captain Bullough was ordered to join his
Battalion, and Captain M. K. A. Lloyd, Grenadier Guards, succeeded him
as Adjutant.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1916.</div>

<p>In January 1916 the Entrenching Battalion was employed on the
second-line trenches, and in constructing gun emplacements for the
artillery. This latter duty involved technical knowledge on the part
of the officers, who had to work from plans supplied to them by the
gunners. About this time it was found that the Amiens&mdash;Somme Canal
afforded better means of transport for rations and road-making material
than the lorries, which had hitherto been used for that purpose; and
it was necessary to make a light railway across some marshy ground
between Bray road and the Canal. The Entrenching Battalion was employed
in making 3000 fascines for this purpose, and the men became so expert
at their work that there was keen competition between the various
companies as to which should turn out the most fascines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>In April 1916 preparations for the offensive operations on the Somme
were begun, and the Entrenching Battalion played a great part during
this battle, which lasted six months. The Guards Division was not
employed in the initial stages of the battle, and it was therefore not
until July that the Entrenching Battalion moved up to the vicinity
of Fricourt, to take over the forward roads in the battle area. The
constant shelling, combined with the heavy traffic, made it peculiarly
difficult to keep the roads in sufficiently good repair for constant
use, but in spite of all difficulties the roads were kept open all
the time, and this was entirely due to the ability and energy of the
officers and the efficiency and discipline of the men. Throughout the
year the duties of the Entrenching Battalion were many and various,
and at times the work was very heavy, but it was always cheerfully
undertaken, because the men prided themselves on being part of the
Guards Division, and knew that more than the average amount of work
done by the other entrenching battalions was expected from them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1917.</div>

<p>In January 1917 the Battalion was employed in strengthening the
defences of Ginchy and Combles, and in the successful operations
against the Germans early that year it participated in the various
works, on which all arms were engaged. In April it was encamped for
some months in the neighbourhood of Havrincourt Wood, and was employed
in preparations for the offensive in the direction of Cambrai, which,
however, did not take place till November. In June the Battalion
made a farther move to Roisel, where for some months<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span> it was busily
employed in digging a line of trenches some nine miles long, from
Epeley to within three miles of St. Quentin. The strength of the
Battalion had now risen to over 2000 men. The work on these trenches
was very interesting, as it was in sight of the Hindenburg line, and
although works of some importance were undertaken, Major Ellice and his
Entrenching Battalion were given complete charge of this area.</p>

<p>Although the Guards Entrenching Battalion had constantly worked in
the forward areas, the other entrenching battalions had been employed
mostly in rear on work which could as easily have been done by labour
battalions or Chinese, and they had consequently diminished in
strength. In September 1917 the attention of the military authorities
was directed to these entrenching battalions, with the result that it
was decided to disband them. General Feilding asked that the Guards
Entrenching Battalion might be maintained, but this was not considered
possible. In October the final disbandment took place.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII</h2>

<p class="center p-left sm">THE RESERVE BATTALION</p>


<div class="sidenote">Reserve Battalion. 1914-18.</div>

<p>The Reserve Battalion, originally known as the 4th Battalion, sprang
into existence at the School of Mines at the London University at
Kensington as soon as war was declared in 1914. Within five days one
thousand seven hundred reservists had arrived from all parts of England
and Wales, and retired officers appeared on the scene, whether they
belonged to the Reserve or not. This mass of men had to be converted
into a disciplined Battalion, non-commissioned officers appointed, and
the whole machinery of a battalion created. Yet so smoothly did the
mobilisation work that within a few days every man was fully equipped,
and companies were drilling in the Park, with N.C.O.'s shouting out
their drill as if they had never been away.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel G. D. White was appointed Commanding Officer, Major G.
W. Duberly Second-in-Command, Captain E. N. E. M. Vaughan, Adjutant,
and Lieutenant J. C. Rolinson, Quartermaster.</p>

<p>The whole conditions of service were now different. Instead of the
usual apathy on the part of the men to learn anything new, they now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
eagerly seized every occasion to acquire knowledge. The Army was no
longer a profession, where a man could reduce to a science the practice
of doing the least possible amount of work without getting into
trouble. It was now a matter of life and death. The latest developments
of modern warfare had to be learnt quickly, and the men, who were
already seasoned soldiers, set to work with a will to learn from
officers and N.C.O.'s at first as ignorant as themselves, the new drill
and the latest method of attack and defence. By the time the Reserve
Battalion moved to Chelsea Barracks, about three weeks later, it had
already become a serviceable body of men. A large number of N.C.O.'s
and old soldiers, mostly "D" section reserve, were selected and sent as
instructors to train the new battalions of "Kitchener's Army." Nearly
all proved excellent instructors, and many privates rose almost at once
to be sergeants and even warrant officers. In the early days of the
war the National Guard and Volunteers did not exist, and consequently
the duty of finding guards to protect the reservoirs, electric power
stations, and other vulnerable points, devolved on the regular troops
in London. The number of small guards all over London was so great that
it took the field officer, whose duty it was to visit them, over five
hours in a motor to go his rounds. About October 1914 the majority of
these guards were taken over by the Special Home Service Units.</p>

<p>Soon the heavy casualties incurred by the battalions in France made the
sending of large drafts necessary, and the Reserve Battalion began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span> to
change completely, with new officers and new men constantly arriving
from Caterham. The number of men in the Battalion became so great that
there were two thousand five hundred men in barracks, and the problem
of accommodation was a very difficult one. Early in 1915, Aylwin huts
were erected at Burton's Court, which somewhat relieved the pressure.
On the formation of the Welsh Guards in February 1915, five officers
and six hundred and thirty-four other ranks were transferred to this
new regiment, and in July of the same year, when it was decided to form
another battalion of the Grenadier Guards from the Reserve Battalion,
the latter automatically became the 5th Battalion.</p>

<p>In February 1916 Lieut.-Colonel G. D. White left to take up a Staff
appointment in France, and was succeeded by Lieut.-Colonel G. C.
Hamilton, D.S.O. From January 1916 until the end of the war, the
Battalion was organised on a nine-company basis in the following
manner: the first four companies were composed of recruits who were
being trained to feed the Battalions at the front. No. 5 Company
consisted of men employed on various duties, and the remaining four
companies, six to nine, comprised sick and wounded men from France.</p>

<p>On May 29, 1916, Lieut.-General Sir Francis Lloyd, commanding the
London Districts, inspected the Battalion, and expressed himself much
pleased with its appearance on parade. General Sir George Higginson
also paid a visit to the Battalion that year, and both officers and
men much appreciated this attention from a veteran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span> Grenadier, who
had fought in the Crimean War. In September a duty, somewhat out of
the ordinary routine, was assigned to the Reserve Battalion. During
an air raid over London, one of the German Zeppelins was brought
down in flames in Essex, and the Battalion was ordered to provide
a guard over what was left of it during the two following days.
In December Lieut.-Colonel Hamilton was given command of the 4th
Battalion in France, and was succeeded by Lieut.-Colonel Lord Francis
Montagu-Douglas-Scott, D.S.O.</p>

<p>Nothing of interest occurred until 1918, when, owing to the large
numbers of men who joined in consequence of the protected trades being
brought under the Military Enlistment Act, a Provisional Battalion was
formed at Tadworth. This Battalion, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel
Maitland, D.S.O., proceeded to Aldershot four companies strong,
leaving behind two companies under Captain Lord Forbes. A month later
Lieut.-Colonel Maitland was succeeded by Lieut.-Colonel G. E. C. Rasch.
Throughout the war the Reserve Battalion found the public duties in
London, and on several occasions provided guards of honour, notably at
the funeral of Field-Marshal Earl Roberts at St. Paul's Cathedral on
November 19, 1914.</p>

<p>Field training was carried out by one company at a time at Basildon
Park, lent by Captain J. A. Morrison, during the autumn of 1914, and at
Bovingdon Green Camp, Marlow, during the summer of 1915, and after that
at Tadworth Camp. In addition, there were specialist courses: bombing
at Southfields and Godstone, Musketry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span> at Rainham and Hythe, Machine
Gun courses and Gas Instruction at Chelsea.</p>

<p>The arduous and somewhat thankless task of continually training men as
quickly as possible, to feed the battalions in France, was successfully
carried on during the four years of the war, and letters from the
four Commanding Officers bear ample testimony to the efficiency of
the Battalion organisation. The greater part of the work fell on the
Commanding Officer, Adjutant, and the senior Captains, whose untiring
efforts will ever be gratefully remembered by the regiment. Day in and
day out, during four long years, these officers strived to maintain
with each draft the high standard of the regiment, and this result
could not have been effected without the invaluable assistance of the
warrant officers and sergeants.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX</h2>

<p class="center p-left sm">THE BAND</p>


<div class="sidenote">The Band. 1914-18.</div>

<p>In the first year of the war it does not appear to have occurred to
any one that the Battalions at the front would wish to have a band,
but when the Guards Division was formed in 1915 the lack of music was
much felt, and it was decided that the regimental bands of the five
Guards Regiments should be sent out in turn. The Grenadier Guards Band
was naturally sent out for the first tour of duty at the front, and
was therefore fortunate enough to earn the distinction of being the
only band that received the 1914-1915 Star. It embarked on October 22,
with Captain A. Williams in command, and proceeded to France. While
in mid-Channel, the ship on which it crossed over collided with a
four-masted Norwegian vessel, and sank her. A thorough search was made
in the darkness for any survivors, and eventually nine of the Norwegian
crew were picked up. The British ship itself was badly damaged, and
for some hours there was great uncertainty whether it would ever reach
port, but it eventually arrived at Havre some six hours overdue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>On arrival the band at once proceeded to Harfleur, which it reached
in time to play the National Anthem, when the King, on one of his
periodical visits, inspected the Guards depot. Later it moved up to
Sailly-la-Bourse, and was warmly welcomed by all ranks of the Guards
Division. Captain Williams at once set to work to organise concerts,
and to make arrangements to play at each Battalion Headquarters. Two
and even three performances were given daily, and visits were paid to
the troops in rest billets and in the clearing stations. The people of
Paris, anxious to take advantage of the presence of this famous band in
France, invited Captain Williams to give a concert at the Hippodrome in
aid of the French Red Cross. This proved to be a remarkably successful
performance, and a sum of no less than £650 was raised. In January 1916
the band was relieved by the Coldstream band, and returned to London.</p>

<p>A second tour of duty in France was undertaken in 1917, when the Guards
Division was on the Somme, and three months were spent at Mericourt
l'Abbé.</p>

<p>A third visit to the front took place in August 1918, just at the time
when the German last effort had spent itself, and the Allied Armies
were making a general advance. On the night of August 21, when the
Guards Division was commencing its advance, the Germans bombed the
whole area in which it was throughout the entire night. Among the many
casualties were three Grenadier bandsmen, and although none of their
wounds proved fatal, the solo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span> clarinettist, a very fine musician, lost
his arm, and thereby his livelihood.</p>

<p>In July 1918 the band attended the French Fêtes in Paris, and remained
there for the celebration of the Belgian Independence. This function
took place in the grounds at Versailles, and was attended by the
principal bands of Great Britain, France, America, and Belgium. On
another occasion in August 1918 the band played in the Tuileries
Gardens in Paris in aid of the American Red Cross Society.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XL</h2>

<p class="center p-left sm">REGIMENTAL FUNDS AND ASSOCIATIONS</p>


<div class="sidenote">Regimental Funds and Associations.</div>

<p>"Grenadiers look after themselves" has become an accepted axiom
not only in war but also in peace time. A short time before the
commencement of the war the Old Comrades Association was instituted
under the auspices of Colonel Scott-Kerr, who commanded the Regiment
at that time, and its object was to ensure that no Grenadier after he
had left the Regiment was ever in want. This Association proved a great
success, and although two years' service was a necessary qualification
for membership, the officers, non-commissioned officers, and men who
joined soon rose to a considerable number.</p>

<p>Another tradition in the Regiment was that those who remained behind
should look after those who went to fight. In the South African war
especially the custom of sending out comforts to the Battalions in the
field was brought to a pitch of perfection, and during the two years
that campaign lasted the 2nd and 3rd Battalions were well provided
for. When the war broke out in 1914, the first care of the regimental
authorities was to see that the men in the Expeditionary Force wanted
for nothing, and also that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span> their families were adequately provided
for. Colonel Gordon-Gilmour, who was temporarily in command of the
Regiment in August 1914, came to the conclusion that the mass of
routine work was as much as the Regimental Orderly Room could cope
with, and that if a Comforts Fund was to be a success, it would be
necessary to invoke the aid of an old officer. He therefore asked
Major-General Sir Reginald Thynne (an old Commanding Officer of the 3rd
Battalion) to undertake the arduous task. At that time all existing
organisations were being strained to their utmost to cope with the vast
numbers of men who were flocking to the army.</p>

<p>As soon as Sir Reginald Thynne grasped the immensity of the task he had
undertaken, he sent round an appeal to all officers past and present,
and raised a substantial sum for the initial expenses. Two funds were
started: the Comforts Fund and the Families Relief Fund. The former was
entirely for men at the front, and was managed by Sir Reginald Thynne
himself. The latter was under the direction of Sir Reginald Thynne as
Treasurer and Colonel C. Rowley as Secretary until November 1915, when
Lieut.-Colonel Viscount Colville became Treasurer and Mrs. Stucley,
Secretary. In September 1914 a small Committee, consisting of the wives
of officers and presided over by Lady Florence Streatfeild, was formed,
and the whole organisation was put on a thoroughly business-like
footing, but the number of men who joined the Regiment increased with
such rapidity that it was found necessary to enlarge the Committee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>The following ladies eventually formed the Committee:</p>

<p>Lady Ardee, the Hon. Mrs. Wilfred Smith, Mrs. Fisher-Rowe, the Hon.
Mrs. Corry (who resigned later on account of illness), the Hon. Mrs.
Dalrymple-White, the Hon. Mrs. Earle (who resigned later and went to
Switzerland to join her husband), Mrs. Montgomerie, the Hon. Mrs. G.
Legh, Mrs. Ricardo, Viscountess St. Cyres, Lady Helen Seymour, Mrs.
Barrington-Kennett, Mrs. St. Leger Glyn, and Mrs. Stucley.</p>

<p>When the Committee first started it was decided to look after families
only on the married roll, leaving the others to be dealt with by the
Soldiers' and Sailors' Families Association, to which the Regiment sent
a subscription of £100; but it was found that families were so well
provided for by Separation Allowances, that it was only in special
cases that assistance was needed. The Committee, therefore, undertook
to assist special cases, whether they were married people on the
strength or not. The ladies of the Committee kept in constant touch
with each family either by correspondence or by personal visit, and by
degrees they were able to ensure that every case was looked after.</p>

<p>When the cold weather arrived, the needs of the men at the front became
of paramount importance, and the wives of officers, non-commissioned
officers, and men set to work to make warm mittens and hand-made socks,
the wool being provided to a great extent by the Comforts Fund.</p>

<p>Owing to certain officers contributing large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span> sums to the Comforts
Fund, which had already been generously supported by the officers,
Sir Reginald Thynne was able to send, in addition to what are called
comforts, newspapers, tobacco, and cigarettes every fortnight, as
well as footballs, boxing-gloves, and other things that the men love.
Colonel Streatfeild also decided to supplement the appliances supplied
by the War Office, and sanctioned the supply by the fund of such
articles as trench periscopes, telephones, and bicycles for orderlies.
Later, gramophones were provided, and when Christmas came Sir Reginald
Thynne was able to send a plum-pudding to each man at the front.
This necessitated 2000 plum-puddings being sent in 1914, and 4000 in
1915 and 1916, in addition to a certain number to the Grenadiers on
the Brigade and Divisional Staffs. During the last two years of the
war, the supply of plum-puddings for all the Expeditionary Forces was
undertaken by the Director-General of Voluntary Organisations.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Prisoners of War Fund</h3>

<p>Early in the war the problem of how to deal with the Prisoners of
War had to be faced, and Sir Reginald Thynne, having organised the
Comforts Fund, now turned his attention to this at the request of
Colonel Streatfeild. The Grenadiers were fortunate in having far fewer
prisoners than other regiments, but the fact that there were men of the
Regiment at the mercy of a country, which had proved itself capable
of the most dastardly cruelty, was enough to warrant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span> energetic steps
being taken at once to ensure that the men in Germany should not starve.</p>

<p>Major-General Sir Reginald Thynne set to work to devise some
organisation by which parcels of food would reach the prisoners
regularly, and a Prisoners of War Fund, to which many old officers of
the Regiment contributed, was started, and in the initial stages was
partly financed by the Comforts Fund.</p>

<p>In the first place it was decided to send all men in Germany a good
parcel of food and some tobacco every fortnight, but this was not
enough, and a system was started by which many prisoners of war of the
Regiment were "adopted" by a lady belonging to the Regiment, a wife, a
mother, or a sister of an officer. The adopter was asked to undertake
the despatch of a parcel once a fortnight, so that with the parcels
from the Fund each prisoner received weekly a sufficient supply of
food. This worked admirably, but the labour involved was necessarily
heavy, since the men were constantly moved from one place to another.</p>

<p>By an arrangement with the American Embassy in Berlin a complete refit
of outer and under clothing was sent to each prisoner by Colonel
Streatfeild, but these were not provided by the Prisoners of War Fund.</p>

<p>This method of supplying food to the prisoners in Germany was not
altogether satisfactory. In the first place, men in good regiments were
much better looked after than those who belonged to regiments where
there was no organisation for the care of prisoners; and in the second
place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span> it was open to abuse. Some men, for instance, wrote to various
people in England and obtained by this means more parcels than they
could possibly want. One prisoner managed by diligent writing to obtain
as many as fifty parcels. The difficulty of getting food into Germany
increased as the war went on, and it was soon found that the whole
problem had become too big for voluntary effort. Accordingly in October
1916 a Central Prisoners of War Committee was formed under the auspices
of the Government, and the supply of regular food was officially taken
in hand with the aid of the American Embassy in Berlin. This did not
entail the abolition of the various regimental funds, but it ensured
every prisoner being provided with an adequate amount of food. After
this the packets of food were sent with a Red Cross label, provided
by the authorities, and no parcel could be sent, unless it had been
packed by the Central Committee, or under their authority, as they were
responsible that the parcels contained nothing that contravened the
regulations. No prisoner was allowed to receive parcels from more than
one authorised organisation.</p>

<p>The following memorandum was issued for the guidance of the prisoners'
relations and friends:</p>


<h3 class="smcap center p-left">System of sending Parcels to Grenadier Prisoners of War in
Germany</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>1. No parcels either of food, tobacco, tea, or clothing can
now be sent by private individuals to these prisoners, nor
should monetary assistance be given to any agency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span> except
our own. Books can be sent to them only through authorised
publishers, such as Mudie's, W. H. Smith, and Bumpus.
Gramophones, boxing-gloves, and a few other such articles
can sometimes be sent by special request through the Central
Prisoners of War Committee, 4 Thurloe Place, S.W.7.</p>

<p>We cannot accept parcels from individuals to be forwarded to
prisoners, but only subscriptions to our funds.</p>

<p>2. Details of parcels are as follows:</p>

<p>(1) Assorted food parcels (weight under 11 lbs. gross) are
sent three times per fortnight to each prisoner at the cost
of £6: 15s. per man per quarter, or £2: 5s. per parcel per
quarter. Each parcel contains 1 cake of soap, and frequently
other necessaries applied for by the men.</p>

<p>(2) 1 lb. of tea (in a separate parcel) is sent out per month
to each man, costing 1s. 8d. per month, duty free.</p>

<p>(3) 250 cigarettes or &#189; lb. of tobacco, as preferred, is
sent to each man (in a separate parcel) costing 3s. 8d. per
month, duty free.</p>

<p>(4) A separate supply of bread or biscuits, according to
season, is sent to the Camps by the Central Prisoners of War
Committee, and each man should receive 4 lbs. per week. In
future we shall have to pay for this, and it will cost us 8s.
per man per month (based on 7s. 6d. per four weeks).</p>

<p>(5) A complete outfit of clothing is sent out to each man
twice yearly.</p>

<p>3. We classify our subscribers as follows:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Adopters</i>, who subscribe for parcels to specified and
named men, paying £2: 5s. per quarter for each fortnightly
parcel. In some cases an adopter pays £4: 10s. for two, or £6:
15s. for three fortnightly parcels all sent to the same man;
in other cases an adopter takes over two men or three men, or
more, and pays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span> for one or more fortnightly parcels each. The
names of the senders cannot, owing to shortage of labour, be
written on parcels, and the subscriber writes to the prisoner
to let him know what is being done for him.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Friends or relations</i>, who subscribe monthly, or
occasionally, for the tea, tobacco, or bread, at the prices
above quoted, or pay 7s. occasionally when they wish to
provide for one of the regular parcels.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Givers of donations</i>, of various amounts to be used as
we think best.</p>

<p><i>N.B.</i>&mdash;It is possible for relations of prisoners by applying
to the Regimental Orderly Room to get allotments made to
them out of the prisoner's pay, in order to enable them to
subscribe to us. This can only be done when a prisoner writes
to say he wishes it, and defines the amount of the allotment.</p></blockquote>

<p>These instructions were altered several times, and new rules and
conditions were added. Soon after the official system came into
force, there was an unfortunate hitch about the bread. The Central
Prisoners of War Committee, which had undertaken the supply, found
that the arrangements they had made for its manufacture and despatch
from Copenhagen were anything but satisfactory; complaints from the
prisoners showed that the system was not working well. Steps were at
once taken by the Central Prisoners of War Committee to rectify the
fault, and afterwards the supply was carried out satisfactorily from
Copenhagen and Berne.</p>

<p>One prisoner, who wished to inform his friends of the true state of
affairs, and who feared his remarks would not pass the Censor, wrote
on a postcard, "1 Corinthians iv. 11." The German Censor's biblical
knowledge was fortunately weak,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span> and he allowed the card to go. The
text referred to was:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst,
and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain
dwelling-place.</p></blockquote>

<p>Early in 1917 the relatives of the men in Germany began to hear more
frequently from them, and to learn how badly some of them were being
treated. Thus a considerable correspondence grew up with these anxious
people, as well as with the prisoners themselves, and General Thynne
had to ask the Lieutenant-Colonel to give him some help. Lieutenant
Bernard Samuelson, who was at that time incapacitated for active
service by wounds, therefore joined in the work; in July of that
year, General Thynne requiring a short holiday, Lieutenant A. O.
Whitehead (also wounded) helped; and when General Thynne returned,
and Lieutenant Samuelson, who had rendered most able assistance, had
rejoined for active duty, Lieutenant Whitehead continued to work with
General Thynne. Being a business man with more than common capacity
and experience, Mr. Whitehead's assistance and powers of organisation
were invaluable, for the clerical work and correspondence had become
considerable, and he devoted himself to the work with the greatest zeal
and interest.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1917 it became very difficult to procure the necessary
supplies of provisions; in fact, some essential articles were
absolutely unobtainable. It was, therefore, decided to ask<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span> the Central
Prisoners of War Committee to pack and despatch the parcels, which
they were able to do, as they had very large contracts for supplies;
and this they continued to do with most satisfactory results until the
cessation of hostilities, November 11, 1918.</p>

<p>During 1918 the number of prisoners greatly increased, principally
because the 4th Battalion had been surrounded by the enemy, when under
orders to hold the position at all costs near Merville, and, whilst
losing heavily in casualties, had had over 250 men captured. The other
Battalions lost some men captured during the fighting in August and
September, thus bringing the total up to 475, including 27 men interned
in Holland, and 6 in Switzerland, besides several badly wounded men
repatriated, 3 who died in captivity, and 2 who escaped.</p>

Officers, and, in addition, the late Major-General Hon. W. S. D. Home
and Captain T. F. J. N. Thorne each bequeathed £1000 to the Fund. A
total of £18,000 was invested in addition to the sum of £2100 placed at

<p class="center p-left"><i>Roehampton Hospital Beds Endowment</i></p>

<p>An appeal was made in 1916 to Officers, past and present, to enable
Grenadier Guards Beds to be endowed in Queen Mary's Convalescent
Auxiliary Hospital, Roehampton, where limbless men receive special
treatment, are fitted with artificial limbs, and taught how to use them.</p>

<p>A sum sufficient to endow eight beds for two years was obtained,
and sufficient donations have been received since to enable the
Lieut.-Colonel to renew the endowment of two beds for four years.</p>


<p class="center p-left"><i>Star and Garter Hospital</i></p>

<p>In June 1918, a room at the Star and Garter Hospital at Richmond
was endowed by G. H. Windeler, Esq., the father of the late Second
Lieutenant H. W. Windeler, the necessary funds having been subscribed
by the Boston friends of that officer and of the late Second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
Lieutenant Hartley, Coldstream Guards, and Mr. Farnsworth, French
Foreign Legion. The room was named after these officers. Nomination to
the occupation of the room was in the hands of the Officers Commanding
Grenadier Guards and Coldstream Guards, the right to nominate to run
alternately, commencing with the Grenadier Guards.</p>


<p class="center p-left"><i>Holiday Homes</i></p>

<p>By the generosity of an Officer of the Regiment and his wife, a number
of the wives and children of warrant and non-commissioned officers and
men were sent to the seaside for a holiday every year. These holidays
began first in 1918, and have been greatly appreciated.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX II</h2>

<p class="center p-left">THE TITLE "GRENADIERS"</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Appendix II.</span></div>

<p>During 1915 the whole Regiment was much perturbed by the official use
of the word "grenadier" as applied to men in all regiments who were
being trained to throw bombs. This expression began to creep into
official documents in April, and about this time a memorandum was
published by General Headquarters on the training and employment of
"grenadiers." In June the Army Council addressed a circular letter
to officers commanding battalions, by which authority was given for
the training of a detachment in each battalion, consisting of one
officer, two sergeants, and 56 other ranks, as "grenadiers." Badges for
"regimental and battalion grenadiers" were described in some additional
paragraphs to the Dress Regulations, which were issued in Army Orders
in October.</p>

<p>Eventually Colonel H. Streatfeild decided to take up the matter
officially, and on November 29 sent the following letter to
Major-General Lord Cavan, commanding the Guards Division:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I respectfully beg to bring to your notice, and to strongly
protest against, what I consider is an usurpation of the
rights and privileges of the Regiment under my command, by
the establishment of '<span class="smcap">Grenadiers</span>' to all battalions
of the Army by Army Order of the 11th October 1915, and would
venture to suggest that the name of '<span class="smcap">Grenadiers</span>'
given to Regimental Bomb Throwers be altered to
'<span class="smcap">Bombers</span>.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>"In the <i>London Gazette</i> of 29th July 1815 the First Regiment
of Foot Guards had bestowed upon it the title of 'First or
Grenadier Regiment of Foot Guards' in commemoration of their
having defeated the Grenadiers of the French Imperial Guard at
the Battle of Waterloo.</p>

<p>"This distinction the Regiment has proudly borne for the past
100 years, and it is a source of regret to all ranks that at
this period, when there are four battalions of the Regiment
upon Active Service, this title, which was granted exclusively
to the Grenadier Guards as a reward for services in the Field,
should in any way be invalidated."</p></blockquote>

<p>On receipt of Colonel Streatfeild's protest, Lord Cavan wrote to
General Headquarters:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I beg with great deference to raise a question of privilege.
The word and title Grenadier is now seen in all official
documents to denote a man who throws a bomb. This title was
given to the First Guards for service rendered at Waterloo,
and they are naturally jealous of the honour."</p>

<p>"In conversation the word bomber is general, but if this is
not sufficiently dignified for official documents I most
respectfully suggest that 'bomb thrower' be the recognised
title."</p></blockquote>

<p>To this the Adjutant-General at General Headquarters in France sent the
following reply:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The term bomb is officially confined to projectiles fired
from trench mortars or dropped from aeroplanes. Projectiles
thrown by hand are 'grenades.'</p>

<p>"The G.O.C. Guards Division is in error in supposing that
the Grenadier Guards are the only Regiment in which the word
grenadier forms part of the title of the Regiment.</p>

<p>"It would appear that the term Grenadiers is merely an
unofficial abbreviation of Grenadier Guards, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span> does not
appear in any official documents in relation to that Regiment.</p>

<p>"The Grenade fired proper is the badge of many Regiments,
and it would seem that a claim to the sole use of the title
'Grenadier' has as little foundation as one to be the only
wearers of the Grenade badge.</p>

<p>"It would seem that Modern Warfare has necessitated a partial
return to the Grenadier Companies of former days which it is
believed existed without any prejudice to the rights of the
Grenadier Guards."</p></blockquote>

<p>Lord Cavan, however, could not let the matter rest there, and again
wrote to the Adjutant-General on December 22, meeting the arguments put
forward by him. He said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I beg respectfully to reply to the remarks of the A.G.</p>

<p>"In Para. 2. He says the G.O.C. Guards Division is in error
in supposing that the Grenadier Guards are the only Regiment
in which the word 'grenadier' forms part of the title of
the Regiment. The G.O.C. Guards Division never made this
supposition, and is perfectly aware that the Indian Army
contains the 101st Grenadier and the 102nd King Edward's Own
Grenadiers, and there are also some Colonial Grenadiers,
but he is not aware that any British Regiment has the word
grenadier as part of its title except the First Guards.</p>

<p>"Reference Para. 4. No claim to be the only wearers of
a Grenade Badge was made, but the title Grenadiers was
officially given in the <i>London Gazette</i> of July 1815 to the
First Guards in commemoration of their having defeated the
Grenadiers of the Imperial Guard at Waterloo.</p>

<p>"The title of Grenadier Company is of course of ancient
origin and was almost universal. If resuscitated it would be
welcome and would solve the problem; if a report stated that
'the Grenadier Company of the &mdash;&mdash; Battalion then attacked'
no objection would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span> raised, but if the report was worded
'the Grenadiers then advanced,' I consider it not only an
infringement of privileges but misleading to future historians.</p>

<p>"Had the weapon been the carbine or carabine or the Fusil
the same confusion would have arisen with the Carabineers or
Fusiliers.</p>

<p>"It is in no carping spirit that this letter is written, but
I most respectfully beg to emphasise my point that the title
'Grenadiers' was a battle honour given to the First Guards and
as such should be respected."</p></blockquote>

<p>Finding it impossible to get any redress in France, Colonel Streatfeild
in January 1916 appealed to the King, as Colonel-in-Chief of the
Regiment, and His Majesty promised to look into the question. Nothing
was done till March, and then at last, in deference to the King's
expressed wish, the Army Council decided that in future the word
"Bomber" should be used instead of "Grenadier." The decision was
embodied in the following Order:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="smcap r2">War Office,</p>

<p class="r1"><i>28th March 1916.</i></p>

<p class="smcap p-left">673. Bombers.</p>

<p>The term "Grenadier" will no longer be applied to men trained
or employed in the use of hand-grenades.</p>

<p>Such men will in future be designated "Bombers."</p>

<p class="r1">121/7862 (A.G. 1).</p>

<p class="r4">By Command of the Army Council,</p>

<p class="r1">(Signed)&emsp;&emsp;R. H. BRADE.</p></blockquote>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
